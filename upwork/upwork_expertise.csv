I specialize in PHP and MySQL. That is the backbone of a dynamic website; it's the foundation and the nuts and bolts that make your website work.

I also do JS/Jquery/AJAX, CSS and HTML. That's the part that controls the user experience. It connects with the backend and delivers the goods to the user. 

Above all, I listen and communicate. I consider clear communication to be a significant part of my responsibilities as a web guy- to be able to explain technical things to non-technical people. We need to be on the same page and have the same expectations so I am not wasting your time and money.

In eight years as a full-time web programmer, I've worked with dozens of technologies. Wordpress, Salesforce, Codeigniter- honestly, too many to list.

I've worked on numerous types of projects, like CRMs, APIs, data analysis/number crunching, multimedia, and automation of a wide variety of business processes.

I am NOT a professional-grade graphic designer. I have a good eye for the basics of UI and design, and I can work with/fix existing designs in HTML and CSS. The majority of my projects involve a design supplied by another developer, which I then utilize to build a working program.

I have a BA in Computer Science. I also got a perfect score (800) on the SAT-Verbal. I live north of Atlanta, GA. 

If you're interested, please, give me a shout. I look forward to talking with you.

If you're looking for the best quality and service, hiring someone who wants to build that relationship with you is essential to success. Beyond this, finding a freelancer with a true passion for writing helps ensure quality content for your website.

As a former high school English teacher, I emphasized quality and attention to detail by nurturing my students' creativity. I taught high school students (grades 9-12) for 8 years in the public school system. I am now pursuing my own passions as a career freelance writer.

As of July 2017, I am also the owner of the Phoenix Heart Writing Company, a new writing agency here on Upwork. You can choose to hire me directly for any of your writing needs or hire my trusted writer and myself for the same price. Through the agency, I offer writing and editing services for one cost, a good alternative for those who want quality writing and editing for their content.

I earned a Bachelor's in English, with a minor in Education, from the University of Maryland, College Park. My teaching experience has been wide and varied, covering all areas that one can imagine for an English teacher to cover: poetry, short stories, creative writing, academic writing, technical writing, persuasive writing, and especially journalism. I have a strong passion for analytical and expository writing and a deep love of rhetoric. A blank page is my canvas, and I am able to craft imaginative, informative, and entertaining material. 

One of my current, personal goals is to continue developing my skills at content writing for the web, WordPress mastery, and developing a keen understanding of customer profiles and SEO techniques.

I am also what you might call a news junkie; I'm a constant consumer of it from an extremely varied number of sources. I'm passionate about science fiction, anime, and video games. 

During my few years as a freelance writer, I have etched out significant success by focusing solely on relationship-building with my clients. I believe strongly in only taking on jobs or tasks that I believe I can do to the best of my ability, and to which I can devote adequate time to get the job done extremely well. If I apply for a freelancing job with you, know that I am only applying because I believe that I can give you maximum quality with superb effort.

Hi, my name is Jeff and I help health and wellness businesses get more impact and sales by changing the way they use their words. 

The power of good copywriting lies in how the right words subtly address and engage the unspoken needs, desires, and emotions of the prospect – the REAL drivers of decision-making.

This is how readers become buyers. This is how customers become raving fans. This is how your business maximizes its profit. 

Regardless of the form – sales writing, email marketing, social media, a VSL, press releases, web copy, whatever it is – the underlying principles of how to connect to and persuade someone are the same as they’ve always been. There are only different mediums in which to apply the same time-tested principles of Direct Response Copywriting. 

Whether you want to increase conversions, get a higher click-through rate, or stand out in your market, the words you use to communicate are key. Quality copy is a powerful solution. 

But it’s more than just “persuasion” 

It’s voice. It’s style. It’s how your words convey who you are. It’s how well you know your audience, and then combining it all to magnetically attract the people who already want what you sell. 

You may also want to consider the broader element of strategy: the way all your different pieces of content (and, really, everything is “content”), the different pieces of copy all work together in your sales funnel to build a relationship with your prospect and guide them along their buyer’s journey. 

I bring a unique mixture of science, experience, empathy, and inspired wordsmithing that helps your message cut through the clutter, bypass people’s filters and turn readers into buyers. 

We can go as deep as you need, from powerful copy to mapping out an entire content strategy and sales funnel. 

I am here to help you stand out with your message.

I am here to help you connect with your audience. 

I am here to help you get the impact your business deserves...

...all while driving more sales, higher conversions, and profit.

But to do that, you need the right words in the right voice that hit the right notes in your prospect’s mind and heart.

Let's work together to get this to happen for you. 

Send me a message! Let's start a conversation and see if we are a good fit! less","United States"

WHO AM I?

I’m a professional writer living in Portland, Oregon with a lifelong passion for the power of the written word.  I’ve written everything from novels to blogs, sales collateral to web content, ad copy to letters, business proposals to sales plans and training manuals. Not to mention a few thousand papers getting my four kids through high school and college.  I love what I do.  I approach every job intent on finding a happy ending and we aren't finished until we get there.


WHAT IS MY BACKGROUND?

I bring more than thirty years of sales and marketing business management experience to every project, and by this I’m talking about major corporations to mid-size companies and start-ups, working in fields including software, real estate, law, publishing, advertising and services.  I confess to having a particular fondness for high degree-of-difficulty challenges.

JUST HOW DO I DO WHAT I DO?

By asking questions, listening and considering what I hear, followed by collaborative brainstorming to develop a plan we both embrace with confidence and enthusiasm.  As you seek synergy within your organization, I seek it with my clients. It pays huge dividends.

The common thread is in finding the way to communicate more effectively, internally and externally, with staff, customers and prospects. The common challenge is in identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and unique competitive factors confronting each client.

I want every aspect of your workday to make sense so you can achieve more. I want your hours to fit perfectly, like the pieces of a puzzle. It does not matter what kind of business you are in – I know you are busy. One of my core assets is to have the flexibility and experience to help and put myself in your shoes - I am a business owner as well.

I have only one focus: to make your life easier, because your goal is my goal. I give you your time back so that you can dedicate it to the things that really matter in your business or in your personal life, leaning on three basic principles - organization, simplification, and specialization.

I am an independent virtual project manager, virtual assistant and digital marketing specialist. I help startups, entrepreneurs and individuals with aspects of running a business, specialising in lead generation, executive assistance, digital marketing and content creation. I have multi-faceted experience from my involvement in many different types of projects and clients. 

I am a multipotentialite. A person called multipotentialite has three main attributes: idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability. Thanks to working in various industries (construction, education, tourism, consulting, IT), living in different countries (Poland, Sweden, The Netherlands, UK, US, Spain) working with different organisations (large, small, NGOs, local government and Universities), learning different things (music school, graphic design school, climate change policy building, teaching Maths, volunteering, providing career advice, freelancing) I am able to link already accumulated knowledge with new skills and fresh ideas and therefore create added value to every project that I am working on. 

My philosophy concentrates on Kant’s way of perceiving freedom. I am developing the capacity to obey the laws that I give to myself.  It involves control over my life as a whole so as to complete the plans, promises, and decisions.

Marketing, business development and digital communication are the areas of my interest because they involve social part of the employment.  The audience is at heart of any communications activity. Creating engaging content, using digital tools to communicate stories and information, building marketing plans as well as holding creative discussions with customers are highly challenging, yet very rewarding practices. My experience shows that building long-term relations with customers and stakeholders will eventually create a strong network of ambassadors of the company’s brand.

My expertise:

+Digital Marketing (Social Media, Wordpress, Blog, Email, SEO, Keywords)
+CRM and Lead Generation
+Online and Offline Research
+Translations (English-Polish -Spanish)
+Design (Canva, Photoshop, InDesign)
+Project Management

Education:

+MSc in International Business Management (Oxford Brookes)
+MSc in Sustainability and Planning (Cardiff University)
+MSc in Political and Social Science (Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands)
+Project Management Foundation Degree (Tischner European University, Krakow)
+BA in Town Management (University of Economics in Krakow)

I do electronic hardware design from concept to production. I have design experience with retail commercial, industrial, and hobbiest grade products. Schematic design and capture, PCB design, layout, and manufacturing, BOM (Bill of Material) construction and sourcing are just a few of the skills. I use professional software such as Pulsonix for my PCB work and deliver schematic and PCB files in native formats, PDF, and gerbers where applicable. I have a PCB shuttle service I run to get high quality PCB's back from fabrication within 4 days at minimal cost, and I have connections overseas with turn-key capable assembly factories for low, medium, or high production runs.

MECHANICAL:
I have experience using Solidworks Professional and AutoCAD software to design 3D objects. Everything from a custom automotive headlamp to more frequently electronic enclosures. I have a C02 Laser cutter and two dual extruder 3D printers that I use for rapid prototyping. I then have strong connections with factories overseas for higher volume production runs. 

FIRMWARE:
Embedded system and firmware development is another strong skill I possess in languages such as C, C++, and assembly on various architectures by Microchip, Atmel, Motorola, TI, and more. My firmware is used in commercial, industrial, and automotive areas. I can design and support Arduino, Edison, and other embedded platforms or make a fully custom hardware design for your particular solution. 

SOFTWARE:
On the software side, I am experienced in C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Javascript, and more. I have a multitude of websites live written by myself and even desktop applications deployed in industries around the world. I love to tackle interesting projects. I prefer to work on desktop applications in C#, and web applications in Javascript/PHP/MySQL both of which provide powerful combinations and the fastest most reliable entries to the market.

EDUCATION:
I have two Bachelor of Science degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. 

AWARDS/BACKGROUND:
I started my own business almost a decade ago and currently sell products in multiple stores including the giant Amazon.com. I learned many of my skills through schooling and teaching myself and am always innovating. While many people have one narrow focus, I have a much broader set of skills honed for efficiency and creativity. I have won awards for architectural design and structural design and all of my products have been well received and given high star reviews. 

When creating a product you usually need a team of people to work on various aspects of the design. Inherently this system is flawed because of the inefficiencies of communication between all these people and the total cost of hiring so many different people. Every time a transfer of part of the idea occurs between two people (such as the electrical engineer telling the mechanical engineer where the PCB standoffs moved) you are paying for two professional engineers' time at a minimum and because they are not engaged in what the other is doing, oversights and delays are almost assuredly introduced without strict management. When you hire one person to do all these details for you, from conception to production, you save in the long run. One person to communicate with who is able to juggle all the various technical details and not waste time.

Please send me a message or invite me to apply to any jobs where you want them to succeed. Together with me, it will happen. less","United States"

Software development is my greatest skill and I have an incredible attention to detail and perseverance in getting the job done, and done well.

I've been developing native Objective-C iOS apps for over 6 years (since iOS 4) and Swift for over 2 years. I don't use cross platform tools like PhoneGap or Appcelerator. I have direct experience with Apple's policies, device capabilities and account management procedures from publishing my own apps and client apps (see my portfolio for screenshots and iTunes links).

By hiring me you would benefit from my extensive skills and experience. Technologies change, but first-class analysis, design, development, testing and debugging skills can only be built from many years of hard work and real-life development experience.

I work from home in a distraction-free environment using a Mac with dual 23"" monitors. For good test coverage I own many iOS devices including iPhone X, 10.5"" iPad Pro and a 42mm Apple Watch. I don't believe you can get the true ""feel"" of an app by just using the simulator. For client testing, I can use TestFlight to deliver builds throughout the project.

Thanks for taking the time to read my profile. I'm looking forward to working with high-quality product designers and creating some great apps together. less","United Kingdom"

As a copy editor I excel at clarifying ideas, rooting out misspellings as well as grammatical and syntactical errors, and making content conform to the style guide of your choice.


As a merchandising manager at Barnes & Noble.com I used my copywriting and creative skills to merchandise books and software in nearly two dozen categories -- from Business, Computing, and Medicine to Sex and Relationships. Most notably I helped grow BN.com's Rosetta Stone language software line from $800K to over $3 million in 3 years.


I've managed the building of minisites offering more than 1,500 SKUs, collaborated with creative services, merchandisers, and email marketers to coordinate construction and meet unforgiving deadlines, and written, edited, and proofread copy to meet exacting standards. I'm comfortable marking up copy with basic HTML tags, using Google AdWords to research keywords, and tweeting to pique curiosity and clickthroughs on Twitter. I've also used Google Analytics and Coremetrics' web metrics platforms to track and enhance customer traffic.

I supervised dissertations and assisted in statistical consulting for Results chapters 

In my consulting career, certainly after joining Upwork, I have learned that problem definition is critical. A problem well defined is half solved. I rely upon my analytical skills, honed from over 30 years in academe and the business world. I pride myself on my insight and ability to identify what needs to be completed. Consequently I feel well qualified to assist on any project that requires analysis, enquiry and evaluation. Additionally, I have used SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) extensively and have consulted on numerous consulting projects in business and elsewhere, using techniques common in all disciplines. Before initiating a statistics project, I ask myself, what are the hypotheses? What are critical variables in your problem? What do you believe the relationships between variables are?  Because of my analytical and statistical skills, I have consulted on statistics projects in business, psychology, including all social sciences, finance with a profile of a hedge fund, and, recently, and several medical research projects, from testing experimental treatments to calculating needed a priori sample size with statistical power computations. I have designed and analyzed surveys for my entire career, both in academic research and consulting. I would very much like to speak with you.

My strategy of working is to deliver fast and clean code tested with unit tests.

While working hours I am absolutely focused on projects and have not bad habits which will badly influence on work productiveness.

I know who looks at my profile is interested in my skills, that is why I shared my ideas and skills below. 

I know wordpress to it's tiny corners and accordingly I can realize whatever is required including common function modifications and API integrations, creating themes from scratch.

I use PHP OOP along the plugins and wp common functions in themes.

If you want to see my plugins , please send em your email, 
so that I could give access you in bitbucket.org.

Last plugin that I have created was ""Woocommerce Last Seen Products"" (available in bitbucket.org).

For getting  full responsive  layouts I  use Bootstrap CSS v4 and to make it attractive - animate.css and hover.css.

PerfectPixels to compare my html, css with your design or psd to make them 100% identical.

What about Yii2
I am using Yii2 common functionally such as ActiveForm, Object, Query, Model Query Builder, Role Base Access, Widgets,  not telling about Gii, migrations, model custom rules, yii2 extensions for specific cases.
In one word whatever is natural to Yii2, and in addition to all this  I architect models for completing the whole app.

While developing with Angular JS I use the following tools and solutions 
Directaives -  for widgets ,
Factories -  for saving neccassuary data/functions later to use them along the pages, 
unlike others who use AngularJS inside php frameworks sometime fill app with hard coded labels components and page address. I am avoiding that because of well structured site structure.
I am going to deliver you fully controlled and responsive frontend which will be ruled by Angular JS.

""After struggling for almost 2 months to get my web site right through another service, Patrick took care of everything in less than a week. He also made valuable suggestions to improve what we had already done too."" - Matt, Palatine, IL

How Can We Help?
======================

Hiring sucks! You've hired budget developers in the past and wound up with bottom-quality work that needed to be redone from scratch. Read on to find out why my profile is the last one you'll ever have to read.
 
Hi, I'm Rick Mac Gillis. Most developers on Upwork are just starting their careers and they don't understand how to develop software in a way that will continue to save you money.
 
When you hire a software engineer, shouldn't you get what you pay for? Zapier provides a platform to connect all of your existing API-enabled services together, and my past clients have saved tens of thousands of dollars each year with it. But what happens when Zapier doesn’t integrate with your software?
 
Case Study: Bluewater Yacht Sales needed to display thousands of boats, both their exclusive listings, and the ones on a given MLS.
 
Results: Through the implementation of a modular design, their software can easily switch between MLS providers and adapt to their ever changing needs. The modular design prevented the need for a complete rewrite on multiple occasions, saving them an estimated $10,600.
 
Horror Stories Most Developers Create For You
======================================
 
♦ The developer will integrate one API and build your software around that API. If you ever switch providers or add to it, the software must be rewritten. You can easily lose $1,000s of dollars when expanding your software.
♦ Expect huge blocks of code, much of which repeats in several places, making your software an absolute *NIGHTMARE* to maintain. Unfortunately most of my clients have suffered through this problem and had to have their software built over from scratch.
♦ When the project ends, your software has bugs you didn’t even know were there. Now you need to spend 5 more hours finding a new developer to troubleshoot your software and spend another $500 to pay the new guy.
 
My No-Nonsense Approach
======================
 
♦ Your software will be designed using a modular approach so your code can grow organically, just like your company.
♦ Zero code gets repeated, and all sections of code are very small and compact for easy code reuse. In short, your project is *EASY* to maintain for any developer.
♦ If you find a bug in my code within 30 days of closing the project, I’ll repair the bug at no additional cost, GUARANTEED!
 
I know you're an extremely busy person, so let me help you lighten your load and increase your budget by building software that won’t crack your back.
 
WHAT TO EXPECT
 
♦ Receive a reply to your messages within 1 day.
♦ You'll get periodic project updates - Stay in the loop without the constant barrage of messages.
♦ Heck, my clients seem to treat me as a friend. Be prepared for a professional friendship!
 
BONUS
 
To save you potentially $100,000 each year, I wrote the book entitled ""The New Frontier in Web API Programming"" to show your team how to reduce unnecessary latency bloat on your server that's costing your company money.
 
Dennis Jarecke states that ""Rick puts your team on the cutting edge of web technology with simple strategies and insights that only an industry veteran can deliver."" As my client, you are entitled to a free copy of my book. Just ask.
 
So what are you waiting for? Send me an invite to your project right now by clicking the big green ""Invite to Job"" button on the top-right of this profile page, and let's discuss your needs!
 
* Prices listed are ballpark figures, and they do not reflect the actual cost of your project. Every developer charges different rates based on the quality they produce, and the scope of the project.

FEW TESTIMONIALS FROM MY PREVIOUS UPWORK CLIENTS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  have entrusted Hanan with a job that had to be delivered to one of my customers. 
The job was a 3D animation based on an idea. I had no proper script and very little insight on the 3D animation world.
Hanan was capable enough to articulate my idea to me and execute it in a record time.
Along the way, we had several changes to the script that were taken on by Hanan with great patience and open mind.
I strongly recommend Hanan for 3D jobs, and will gladly work with him on future projects

- Abdul is an amazing artist and animator. He is able to clearly understand the client's needs and is only satisfied when the results are 100% perfect. His English is remarkable and together with his professional and courteous demeanor he is a perfect fit for any job. I look forward to working on many more jobs together and would recommend his company to anyone, without reservation.

- Excellent work, great communication, outstanding skills. I was really impressed and even decided to paid extra for this task. Definitely I will hire Abdul again.

- I chose abdul after reading his impressive resume and viewing his portfolio. It turns out, I made a good decision. He constructed an animated beating heart along with an ECG that looks real to life. The intricate attention to detail is worthy of praise, eg: he made the atria and ventricles both pump, and aligned the 'audio' to the heart beat precisely. The complex task involved the use of various software, yet Abdul completed the task in a matter of days!!

- Abdul was a great animator and he really came through for us when we had a last-minute need. He constructed three, seperate animation wrappers in After effects and provided the AE files at the end of the project. He never missed a deadline and paid close attention to detail with our notes and feedback 

- Great work, Abdul pays close attention to details and knows when to ask questions until the job is just right. He is not satisfied until the customer is. I highly recommend Abdul for all of your graphics needs.

A bit about me:
With over ten years’ experience in writing and editing roles in both corporate and creative environments, I’ve worked in a wide variety of formats—from converting landing pages and concise “About Us” company statements, to organisational policy documents, to children’s poems—and subjects of all types, ranging from legal compliance to animal welfare.

Whether you need a landing page written to boost your conversions, your blogs tightened up, your e-book proofread before sending it out into the world, or your policy manual edited for a consistent tone, you've come to the right place. I can help you make your project shine.


I offer the following services:

Writing: Corporate and creative writing to suit the tone you’re after. Converting copy, powerful articles, web and blog content, “About Us” statements, policies and procedures, creative writing – let’s talk about what you need.

Proofreading: Your document will be free of any spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors; typos will be changed, and the formatting will be consistent.
 
Copyediting: Your writing will consistently follow your desired voice and style, with abbreviations, language, capitalisation, and references all following the same format.

Editing: Your writing will flow naturally, and will be clear, concise, and readable. Sentences can be rewritten, paragraph order changed, and the structure improved wherever required.

Resumes and cover letters: Your cover letter will paint a picture to your prospective employer of what you can bring to their company, and your resume will follow a compelling format that provides evidence to back up your cover letter.

Bio from The Policy Watch Website:
Sultan Mehmood is an economist, econometrician, an academic writer and editor on topics related to economics, finance and political science. He is educated in Rome, Tilburg, Amsterdam, Lahore and Paris. This allows him to not only bring a truly international outlook and a unique perspective to his work but also the analytical tools and methods that are at the very cutting edge of econometric techniques and policy assessments. Currently, he is pursuing a PhD in Economics from the Paris School of Economics. 

He holds two masters degrees: the rigorous post-graduate education in econometrics from University of Tilburg’s prestigious CentER for Econometric and Operations Research and another masters in Public Policy Evaluation from the Paris School of Economics provides him the vantage point that allows him to combine economic and econometric theory with the latest empirical methods of public policy impact assessments and evaluations. 

He has worked on diverse topics ranging from electoral fraud, citizen perceptions in resource rich countries, costs of terrorism, financing constraints in economic crises, foreign aid and its impact, innovation and taxation policy. Mr. Mehmood has worked with leading public policy organisations such as Institute for Research on Development (Paris), Oxfam International (Oxford), Centre for Study of African Economies (Oxford University), Central Bank of Pakistan (Karachi) and Dutch Government (The Hague). 

His background allows to provide our clients both an insider viewpoint of how economic policy is designed, directed and implemented as well as an outsider view of how policy is rigorously assessed and evaluated. Mr. Mehmood manages large data sets and is proficient in writing complex programs in STATA, Eviews, Matlab and R. This allows him to provide timely impact assessments, evaluate aid programs and to perform policy oriented quantitative research meeting the highest standards. less","France"

I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and took up Financial Management as my major. After graduation, I luckily landed up a bookkeeping job in one of the national government agencies in the country. Then, long after that and in search for better opportunities, I decided to shift in the private sector to where I got in as an Administrative Assistant. Because of my passion and dedication, I was awarded as the employee of the year. 

I love to deal with different people of different races to learn more about their lifestyle, culture and behavior-- this encouraged me to work in a BPO company. I worked as a Customer Service Representative for a weight loss company where I assist clients with their needs in taking orders, guide them on how to fill up the application form and remind them with their appointments. I also worked as an appointment setter for 4one Media. I call homeowners if they want to buy or sell a property and if they do, I set them up an appointment with our realtor. My recent campaign was on telemarketing where we call and invite business owners to sign up with our website to connect them with customers looking for their type of service.

I am with VWP Manpower Agency as a Telemarketer, Appointment Setter,  Data Entry Specialist and Virtual Assistant. With them I was able to build up a better version of my self. They molded me to be more productive, flexible and passionate in everything I do. Allow me to be part of your company and I guarantee you that I will deliver what is being asked of me, and I will give my one hundred percent to your company. less","Philippines"

I've expanded into the podcast show notes writing niche too. 

I am Upwork's fastest scientific and medical research writer. I can potentially submit a quality research paper in under 12 hours if it is realistically possible. 

My specialty is producing premium quality research papers and articles in a short time. I don't overcharge my clients nor am I the type of writer who forces you to pay when I'm having a mental block. 

Basically, if you're in a hurry then I'm also in a hurry. The fact that I'm fast means every penny you pay me counts towards the project. 

So why do I focus on research and medical writing? Simple: It's my passion. I have a passion for a healthy and fit lifestyle just like most of my clients. You can say I relate to them and that makes it easier for us to work together. Simply put, I talk the talk and walk the walk. 

I also have a university degree in Food Science, Technology, and Nutrition which means my articles are not only well-researched but I myself can verify if the sources are selling facts or mere anecdotes. I don't use ""gurus"" as references; it's either a peer-reviewed journal or bust. 

A few things about my experience in UpWork (formerly oDesk):

* I mostly write for Wordpress sites:
  I'm quite familiar with how it works from both an editor's and admin's point of view.

* I can write like a friend or like a scientist:
  I can change the tone of my articles like changing shirts.

* When it comes to scientific research, Google is my friend and PubMed is my playground.

* I'm no stranger to writing while embedding keywords and linkbacks.
  I understand how a carefully placed keyword which links to your site is crucial for SEO.

* I'm an excellent Blog Admin:
  I've worked with clients who asked me to contribute AND edit guest posts for  their website.

* I've written topics on health and nutrition benefits of different types of food, fat-burning exercises, supplements, nootropics, ketosis and the ketogenic diet, and weight loss. I also wrote a few articles on education as well as healthcare.

* I've done podcast show notes for life coaches, real estate leaders, attorneys, marketing experts, and more.

*I'm also one of the few users on Quora who answer diet/nutrition related questions from a scientific standpoint. I've been getting thousands of views within hours lately and there's no telling how high I can go.

My articles have appeared in many websites and I'll be glad to show you samples if you get interested in hiring me. less","Philippines"

I am a python Django full stack web developer. I have been working with python for 4 years since I graduated. I also have experience in vue.js as a frontend developer for one year.

I worked on so many different projects before like:

-Web Developing -Backend- using (Django, Celery, pyramid, sqlalchemy, Redis, REST API)

-Data Science and Data visualization using (pandas, numpy, scipy, folium, matplotlip)
-NoSQL (Mongodb)
-Linux Administration (I studied RHCSA, RHCE certificates)
-I also have experience with Firebase (real time database)
-Desktop Applications using (Tkinter, PyQt5)
-Software Testing (pytest, selenium test, karma and jasmine to test javascript code)

I have an incredible intention to detail and do not stop until the project is complete. I also can manage my time well, eager to learn new things and fast learner too so that I got many certificates and leaned many technologies in a short time.

The most project I am proud of is “slickcentral” it is a software platform allowing retailers & brands to seamlessly integrate with Jet, Walmart, Amazon, Shopify and Epay marketplace. I work as a full stack python django developer and write unit & selenium test. I also do front end stuff using vue.js and write tests for it as well.

I am a 27 years old engineer in Computer Science from France. After graduating from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées of Rennes, I moved over to Sweden to follow a master program on Mobile Systems. Meanwhile, I was also working as a freelance web-developer/project co-leader for a Canadian company. While learning, I participated as a trainee to many professional project and learn to be flexible both in my ways of working in a team and on the technologies to use. Indeed, even so my major programming languages are Java and PHP, I could easily learn C# during my master thesis in Sweden and build up a nice piece of software to work with Sifteo cubes. 

Software architecture and system design are two of my strong background points, thus I thrive in realizing project from the beginning until the end. My professional experiences involved many non programmer and non computer scientist customers and allowed me to train establishing their needs and to translate them into sprints, backlog and deadlines. 

I also believe that knowledge in computer science without knowledge of the real world are wasted hence my interests for books, sail, roller-skating, ice hockey as well as environmental questions for instance.

My name is Kanat. I am a Back-End developer from Kyrgyzstan working mainly with the following stack of technologies: 
Laravel PHP framework,  SQL family databases (MySQL, Postgre, SQLite), Javascript (NodeJS, frontend JS), Git, *nix family OS, also have knowledge of DevOps tools and easily deal with AWS.  

Right now, Laravel is my main tool and I have a good knowledge of the framework's core and its components. I have a subscription on Laracasts.com website and follow Taylor Otwell (Laravel creator and maintainer) and Jeffrey Way (owner of Laracasts) and have worked with all most popular Laravel packages. I know how to write the code that is easy to maintain and reuse and how to build the architecture that can scale without obstacles. 

I also have some basic knowledge of MeteorJS, which I started working with in order to understand the reactive programming and be able to take advantages of that framework and Node.js . 

Other popular technologies that I have worked with include AngularJS, Facebook API, Google API (not only for oAuth), Parse.com, MongoDB, some basic knowledge of other languages and frameworks, like Python-Django and Node.js - Express and MEAN stack... Actually there is no point in going on with this list, because a good developer should be able to quickly get grasp of any tool or framework. 

I am not a strong webdesigner, I usually use Bootstrap framework based templates (mostly from WrapBootstrap.com). 

My favorite teamwork tools are Git and Vagrant.
Talking about Git - I have no troubles with branching, forking, tagging, etc. and can easily teach anybody how to use it. It greatly simplifies the collaboration when writing code.

Vagrant allows you to setup the necessary environments with ease (with a single command), which greatly simplifies the deployment and adding new developers to the team.  

For me web development is more than a job. I am a problem solver (though I have to admit, there are tasks, that might be impossible for me, but that is the same for any developer). You can always consult with me on any affair related to backend web development. I try to give people I work with the clear view on what I am doing and why. 

I know how explain in plain words, how to make apps scalable, what should be done to simplify the teamwork and make workflow smoother. Such things  will help you a lot in long term even if you won't work with me anymore. 

Since it is very easy to start building software and quickly add plenty of functionality, it catches off guard when a project runs into maintanence hell unexpectedly making it impossible to integrate any new developer and keep on adding functionality. That might easily ruin any chances for future success. 

I try to do my best to give people understanding of how the software works (of course in plain terms). Building software is not just a science but an art as well.

Recently I am working extensively on different projects related to smart homes and digital assistants. I have worked with Amazon Alexa (Echo) and Google Assistant (Google Home) and built multiple projects. You can contact me if you need assistance developing apps based on this solutions. less","Kyrgyzstan"

I studied Industrial & Systems Engineering at Texas A&M University. After school, I worked as an Industrial Engineer at American Express, spent four years as a project manager at an engineering firm, and then spent three years as a Business Analytics consultant for IBM - where I worked on projects like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, automating financial reporting capabilities for one of the world’s largest investment management companies, and partnering with a leading pharmaceutical company to help evaluate the state of the mental healthcare ecosystem.

I eventually left consulting to get more experience in operations management, which led me to spend two years in a finance management role at a large industrial supply company before I decided to launch my own company to pursue my passion in software development. 

Working in various industries and sectors over the past ten years has provided me with a great understanding of how business works. Now I'm able to combine my passion for software development with my strong knowledge of business to give you a programmer who understands the bigger picture.

Still here? I’m Tyler Cooper. I'm a Content Writer with a penchant for crafting engaging articles and personality-filled blog posts. 

I specialize in:

*Market Research
*Keyword Placement 
*Injecting Emotionality Into Content
*Writing Powerful Call to Actions 
*Matching Sales Narratives to the Right Audiences 
*Using Language to Create Conversations
*Making Your wildest dreams come true

1) I write like I'm an actual living, breathing human being. For some reason, other writers haven't figured that one out yet. I focus on experiential and emotive writing techniques. 

2) I create conversations by actively engaging with audiences and building trust.

(2) Writing, editing, and proofreading (U.S. English). I’ll perfect your message to get the results you want and weed out those small but embarrassing errors.

Glance through my top-ranked test scores below for a sample of my skills with Excel spreadsheets, writing, editing, and proofreading.

-----------------------------------
HOW I’LL WORK WITH YOU
-----------------------------------

(1) Taking time to understand your needs and explore the best solution.

Sometimes you’ll know exactly what you need. Sometimes we’ll have to refine your ideas and identify possible solutions through discussion. Either way, I will work with you and ask any questions necessary until I fully understand how to complete your project the way you want, in both the big picture and the details.

To ensure that your project (especially writing or spreadsheet formatting) is done in the style you want, I can show you my initial work after starting, so that we can implement your feedback before getting too deep into the project.

Before I start work, I’ll make sure that we have clearly defined the project’s budget and scope. But I will also be flexible to make any changes you want. If I discover a way to do the job better, I’ll discuss it with you and get your permission before spending more time than we planned.

(2) Responding quickly to your questions and keeping you updated on our progress.

If you send me a message, I will reply within one business day—usually much faster. 

While working on your project, I will send you frequent updates on my progress (unless you don’t want them). I strive to complete every project ahead of schedule. If I foresee that the project will be even a little late due to unusual circumstances, I will notify you right away.

(3) Making sure the project is done right to produce the results you want.

You might say I’m a perfectionist. I enjoy making every detail just exactly right. I promise to apply this level of attention to each project I help you with, while staying within budget.

I also love to make things simple to use. Whether your project is a financial spreadsheet or editing an article, I will make the final product easy to implement. Plus, if you later discover any corrections the final product needs, I will promptly fix it even if the job has been closed.

For Excel spreadsheet projects, I offer my Functional Spreadsheet Support Guarantee. I do my best to thoroughly test my Excel spreadsheets. But sometimes, when unforeseen operations are performed, a spreadsheet will not work properly. I promise to provide any spreadsheet updates and email support you need to make the spreadsheet work as designed, at no cost to you.

And for any project, if you’re dissatisfied, please take me up on my 100% Money-Back Guarantee! (Details below.)

Communications specialist is the best umbrella term for the array of competencies I've developed over the course of my career, from creating social media policy documents to performing web traffic analysis, to managing large-scale web development projects and events promotion. I also have experience broadcasting and doing television appearances.

In addition, I have an extensive background in literary publishing environments. I served for almost four years as a Reviews Editor with Arc Poetry Magazine, one of Canada's longest running literary journals. I solicited and edited hundreds of critical reviews and essays during my time with Arc, in addition to sitting on the magazine's board.

GROW YOUR BUSINESS BY ADDING A QUARTER-BILLION CUSTOMER BASE

You have a great app, site or some product. What can you miss? 260 MLN POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS that speak Russian, one of the official UN languages, and that live in many countries. All of them will never know about your product until you localize it properly. This is not about languages, but about expanding into new markets!

I well know what you don’t want: making your product sound like Google Translate, unnatural, or incorrect. It can ruin your business! You need someone competent in Russian and able to UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR PRODUCT DOES.

Here I am to help. Let's see what should be done to make your Russian content hit the bull’s eye, and do it with style. I meticulously study very complex Russian grammar and syntax all my life, and I really know how to write GENUINE RUSSIAN CONTENT rather than translating your English words one by one that, sadly, many translators tend to do. And as an advanced digital content user, I can deeply understand your product and audience.

LET ME PROVE YOU'RE AT THE RIGHT PLACE

Since 2001, I have been writing or translating (both in English and Russian) for TOP GLOBAL CLIENTS like BBC, Google, Microsoft, Xerox, MIT, Johnson & Johnson, Papa Jones, Flipboard, MediaTek, SurveyMonkey, Narconon, World of Indulgence, KanbanTool, Talk Fusion, Rusal, and many others, getting 5-star reviews almost all of the time. 90% of my clients recommend me to others. I have worked extensively in such fields as software, Web content, news, apps/games, Bitcoin/blockchain, trading, Forex, binary options, marketing, social media, travel, sport nutrition, religion, and this content helped my clients:

√ Open new markets

√ Raise funds

√ Boost sales

√ Win awards

This is all proven record of my work. Everything is in my Upwork portfolio. You are the next!

Don’t worry—you’re in the right place. You’ve made a habit of outperforming, so why not arm yourself with the best tools to help continue your winning streak?

Every. Single. Day.

Don’t worry—you’re in the right place. You’ve made a habit of outperforming, so why not arm yourself with the best tools to help continue your winning streak? 

I can build you a machine that consistently makes you money on your advertising. 
Every. Single. Day. 

I’ve worked at Grundfos.com (boasting more than 19,000 employees) and at LEGO.com (more than 15,000 employees) for more than nine years, as a senior program manager of digital business development and digital transformation.

I have an MSc in Computer Science—a highly unusual education for someone who has led $6 million dollar highly strategic projects with hundreds of people in big corporations and suppliers. 

This means when you work with me, you get a strong skill set broad enough to belong to a team of people—not an individual. You get someone with a digital technology background and a fluency in managing a LOT of $. In other words: I know how to make you even more $! 


Here is a breakdown of how:
1. I make you a strategy that works.
2. I give you a rock solid plan to match it.  
3. I execute the plan for you, making you more $ through high converting campaigns.

My advice to you is simple: you start small, scale conservatively, and win big. 

So if you want to hire someone who can help you with your funnels, but also your back-end services from beginning to end— Hi! I'm your guy. 

Want more details?

Great. I can tell you’re serious about getting high-end quality help. That’s the kind of client I want to work with!

What can you expect working with me?

Exceeded expectations. My greatest success story was a smaller project (only $1m) that sold out in pre-sales and made a revenue of $3m. The crazy part? This realized in pre-launch—ONE month before the big launch—and it was in the middle of a crisis in our market. My stakeholders were happy, once they saw the results and the market went viral! :-)
 
Hire me and you get a professional digital marketing expert with more than ten years of experience developing and launching digital products, funnels, automation, advertising, the works.   

Yes, I’ve created and executed strategy in big organizations. But I've also done segmentation and automation rules, landing pages, sales pages, webinars, video ads, forms, and more. I can code html5, css3, Javascript, PHP; so any custom integration that you need right away is right at my fingertips. I am excellent at troubleshooting problems and finding solutions to capacity, or assisting as an extra hand to get things done.   

Either way, you’re hiring an “extra hand” that is more far-reaching than most. You’ll get:  
1. Constructive feedback—always prioritizing your benefit. If you want one thing, and I see a better solution, I will suggest it to you even if it means less work for me...  
2. Because what that means you’ll get faster results...
3. Which in turn builds a trusting business relationship. And that makes the sale infinitely more valuable to us both.

Yep. I went there. But hey!

Do you want the best people working for you or do you want to settle for someone who’s taking your money to build you something you don’t need? Believe me. I've spent a lot of other people's money over the years, and I always turned a profit. I’ve become a master at spotting my “competitors” who don’t.   

So if you want to accelerate and scale your business via digital marketing with someone who's got the record and experience, whose walk matches his talk, then look no further. (You’re welcome to check out my LinkedIn profile to see more.)  

Go ahead and click that green button.   


I’ll leave you with my final sales pitch:

If you like what you read, you'll love working with me.

To get a taste of what you'll get—consider hiring me for a one hour strategy session. 

If that helps you, consider hiring me for this project, and I'll refund the strategy session.   

Or if you already think I can help you, just go ahead and hire me, and I'll give you a free strategy session as a bonus. 

It’s a win-win, right?   

Thanks for reading this. I truly can’t wait to get to work with you.

✅ Full SEO Workup:
As an SEO expert with over ten years of experience in SEO, I will implement my special brand of SEO on each and every page. I inspect each and every page, look for problems affecting your current SEO and SERPs, and then work to make sure each page has the highest possible SEO score implemented. This goes above and beyond H1 tags and meta data. I can also include product, review, service/business or local JSON schema markups.

✅ SEO Content:
I’m available to help your website generate more leads and reach a wider audience with SEO content curation. This is the generation of information categorized into folders under a menu, related articles that are rich with SEO and show high in the search results. The more quality information you have using the best practices in SEO, the more Google and other search engines will be convinced that you are an authority on the subject and authority increases trust and rank. A high quantity of quality articles also increases your digital footprint, allowing more people to find you organically through a number of long-tail keywords.

Bachelor of the Arts (1997) from Lawrence University, Appleton, WI.
Former columnist at SeacoastOnline.
Current editor for The Portsmouth Review.

- Making changes to their app don't cost them more because I developed it to be scalable.
- Very robust code delivery which made my client love my services more.

Now the main question, WHY you should work with me?
Answer: You will find in me a, friend if you are just starting off from zero, a consultant if you need support at intermediate stage, and a true professional developer if you are ever stuck in moving forward with your idea.

You will surely get some guys around to finish it just as job for money. But you will find me being IN and OUT with your product, where I consider it as my product and deliver you that level of service. For me just finishing good is not important but LONG term RELATION is very important.

-Upwork review, December 2016

There is no better way to communicate complex technical concepts than through video. And when you need a top-quality video to showcase your project to the world, I’m ready to help.

I have years of experience in creating first-class videos for software companies around the world. By combining a deep understanding of software with creative video production skills, I am able to get even the most abstract of concepts across clearly and effectively. 

For software developers, being at the cutting edge of technology can be difficult. You're solving an important problem in a beautiful way, but getting that message across to users and investors is HARD. Maybe you've even spent a fortune on an animated explainer video, only to have someone say something like: ""Nice video! But... what do you actually do?""

I get it...because I am a graduate software engineer myself. I have combined my detailed understanding of software development with a natural flair for creative work.  As a result, I am able to produce software demo videos that both explain and impress. 

Forget homemade videos or the template productions you find on Fiverr. I specialize in producing quality work that showcases your product in the best possible way...paving the way for exponential sales, growth and success. 

My speciality is creating videos that give people that magical ‘Aha!’ moment.  You can be sure that your viewers will want to share your content on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other social networks. When you work with me, you get videos that:

- Elegantly explain what you do
- Show off your product by showing screenshots of your actual product
- Get straight to the point (typically 30 seconds - 3 minutes in length)
- Leave people wanting to get started right now!
- Earn you money

I have created first-class video productions and other marketing materials for all kinds of software products, including:

 - Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and Blockchain
 - Ethereum and Smart Contracts
 - Cloud Computing
 - AI, Machine Learning & Data 
 - Infrastructure, Platform, Software as a Service
 - Managed IT Services

You can find examples of my previous work on my Upwork profile, together with references from my many delighted clients. Here’s a brief resume that summarizes my experience:

 - I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Sydney, Australia

 - After graduating, I worked as a software developer developing tech products and showcasing them to the world.

 - During this time, I discovered that I had a natural talent for explaining complex processes in a way that is easy to understand. Consequently, I decided to specialize in video production for software companies

 - Over several years, I have built a reputation as the ‘go to’ person when software developers need to communicate clearly and effectively through video. 

In addition to considerable experience, I pride myself in offering total professionalism, too. 
My background as a software developer has taught me to be punctual and disciplined in my approach. You can be sure that finished videos will be delivered on time and on a budget - even when deadlines are tight. 

I'm easy-going, approachable and love talking about business and tech. So if you have a video project in mind, feel free to send me a message.

- You run your own online business or are one of the C-suite executives in your team. 
- Your data is currently scattered in multiple sources and you are overwhelmed by the amount of data, reports, dashboards shown to you.
- You don't know which metrics/KPIs to track for your business.
- You want to see very simple and effective visualizations to help understand your business performance
- You want to focus on the Few CRITICAL parts of your business (growth, high service, retention, past analysis etc) rather than the minutiae (checking each report, spreadsheet on all different platforms)
- You want to SAVE an EXTRA 5-10 hours/week by not looking at multiple reports, spreadsheets, emails, dashboards etc & still get all the VITAL information you need from all possible sources (Website data, Ads data, Sales data, Leads data etc)
- You want to grow your business by learning from your own live data, your own past failures and successes
- You are still basing your decisions on 100% your gut/intuition but you want to now also use Data for your own decisions , you want to become Data-smart, Data-Driven and leverage it effectively in this constantly changing business scenarios. In this world run by data, it's easy to get behind where all your competitors are crunching data, numbers and using it to improve their business.  

If these sound like the problems you are facing, you have come to the right place.

Imagine a pilot riding an airplane without all the visual screens, reports, live data, buttons - a clear recipe for disaster. Most businesses run without tracking their most important metrics/KPIs and do not anticipate the problems of tomorrow. A pilot knows exactly what to do in each situation and he can see if there is a problem ahead much before to mitigate damages. You have to be on the pilot seat if you want to take your business to the next level.

My goal is to help you make data driven decisions using the power of data visualizations. I want to create the ""Cockpit view"" for your business so that you can steer it wherever you want to.
Data visualizations will help you understand exactly what's going right and wrong in your business very quickly - so that you can take the most important next steps all the time using this and thereby focus on the relevant things rather than minutia like collecting data from different sources, creating reports etc. You will also anticipate problems and understand patterns of your business effectively.

I will help you create a single customized dashboard/report with all your data sources that can generate business insights and help you decide your next set of action steps to rapidly analyze and improve your business.



Website analytics is my forte, but projects beyond website data will definitely be considered depending on the requirements etc

I am generally extremely busy with my ongoing work but certainly open to more challenges and in solving your business problems. We will work together only if we are both a good fit for each other. I am not a service provider, but an expert in my field and the rates really reflect the quality of work and the experience of working with me.

As a writer, I made most of the illustrations for my papers ​and became an expert at Adobe photoshop and illustrator. Thanks. Karl Kjer

""Absolutely stunning and professional work. I was also very happy with Raul's open communication style. He was very up front with days he would be busy or not, and always completed work on time. He was also very responsive to feedback and was generally friendly to work with. Thanks Raul for the beautiful work, and will definitely look forward to working together again!""

""Raul is a master of design. I needed a website which was one of the most beautiful and clear in my industry, and Raul exceeded my expectations. Not only was the website and logo design artfully done, but I was impressed by Raul's ability to intuit what I wanted from the site - even before I really know myself. Raul was hard working, flexible, friendly to chat with, and eye-wateringly talented at design. I will look nowhere else for my future design work."" less","Russia"

Back in 1998, in their research paper ""The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine"", Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin called it ""the art of web research"". Hopefully, 4,700+ hours logged on Upwork will prove my skills in this art.

In spite of having a long list of 'Jobs in progress', I'm currently available more than 30 hours/week.


My values; your ROI:

✔ Creativity 
I believe that creativity is one of the most important free tools at our disposal. 
When information/data is hard to find, I add creativity to perseverance. Creativity helps me come up with several keyword combinations, or it may as well guide me in using other search engines or even other languages, such as French or Spanish.


✔ Perseverance
I believe that steady efforts to achieve something always pay off. 
Web research can be an extraordinarily challenging task. Sometimes the information/data that I'm looking for seats shining on the surface. Sometimes, it’s buried deep down. Perseverance allows me to easily endure the need to keep searching.


✔ Focus
One of the most striking aspects of web research lies in the fact that I’m constantly being bombarded with all sorts of useless information. There are many voices on the web – this is noise. But only a few are worth hearing – this is 'focus'. I fight for keeping a focus, meaning that I always look for the most relevant, credible, sources.

WANT TO HIRE... moreI'm a professional author, editor, proofreader, and recruiter. As an author, I have professionally published a dozen short stories, edited an anthology on Amazon, and am an active member of SFWA. Recently, I was a Finalist in the Writers of the Future contest, based in Hollywood, California. 

As a recruiter, I've been in the recruiting business for twelve years, and own Talent Recruiters, Inc., based in Denver, Colorado. I can find the right fit for your open position.

WANT TO HIRE ME? 

I get sixty connects per month, and I burn through almost all of them in the first two weeks of the month, sending in proposals to projects that I KNOW I can do. I charge ten cents a word for my writing, two cents a word for proofreading, and five cents a word for editing. To many potential clients here on Upwork, that's too expensive. So my connects disappear with, mostly, no hires. 

But, and please pay attention to this, I have had clients who give me an error-riddled manuscript that has been through THREE editors on Upwork, and it is still utter crap. These clients complain about my rates, and say that they've already spent way too much on the mediocre editors they've already paid. Three times, in that instance!

So I ask them: ""Had you paid my expert rates first, and gotten a quality product the FIRST time, would you have spent less, overall?

The answer is always ""Yes.""

So if you're looking at this and wondering if you should hire me, know that I'm expensive, but for a REASON.  I'm an expert recruiter, writer, and editor. I've spent the years necessary to be good at what I do. I won't let you down.

And, if you hire me first, you won't have to hire a series of intermediate (cheaper) freelancers who then leave you with a stinking mess.

Send me an invitation, which costs you nothing and saves my connects, and we can talk.

Thanks! :)

Here are my qualifications:

WRITING: I have a degree in English from the University of Miami and put myself through college as a medical transcriptionist, so my typing speed is pretty good, and my vocabulary is great! For the past ten years, I've been writing short stories and am professionally published. I've had work published in Daily Science Fiction, Galaxy's Edge Magazine, and a variety of anthologies. For a link to either my website or my Amazon author page, please click the links in my Portfolio.

EDITING: I have also edited countless manuscripts and have an excellent grasp of the English language. Recently, I helped edit the anthology ""More Alternative Truths,"" which can be found on Amazon. If you need something proofread or edited, I'm your guy!

RECRUITING: By day, I run a recruiting firm and have been a recruiter for over eleven years. If you are struggling with finding the right fit for your open position, please hire an expert: me. less","United States"

In terms of dialing, I speak neutral accent, US or Aussie English, or Singlish. whichever will work best for your campaign. I have worked with various accounts, Bank New Acquisition Campaign (ANZ Bank), Telco (Verizon, Sprint, Optus, Dodo, Telstra), Australian Energy Retail (EnergyAustralia, TRUEnergy), Credit Repair (Lexington Law, CreditAssist), Private Insurance, Real Estate, IT Solutions (Melbourne IT).

I can work flexibly whether you would want me on the phones or handling a team/department or working independently on research work/marketing/administrative tasks. I am client-oriented and would pace work and align myself to what or where my client is most passionate to achieve.

I have been working in the online freelance business since 2012, it started out as part time and later on migrated my business here FULL TIME because it offered flexibility and better income opportunities.

During my online freelance, I have expanded my experience to doing tasks like Email and Social Media Marketing (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.), Lead Generation, CRM Management, eCommerce (such as Amazon Seller Management), as well as utilization of available searches for Web Analysis (such as Google Analytics, Alexa, SimilarWeb) to use data on Traffic, Bounce Rate, Traffic Composition Audience etc for eCommerce, Excecutive Assistant/Virtual Assistant/Personal Assistant/Virtual Receptionist/Appointment Setter/Email & Calendar Manager, Cloud Drive manager - Googe Drive/Docs, DropBox, iCloud or other cloud drives, Telesales (B2C/B2B), Live Transfers, Minor Web Content Writing/Blogs.

In terms of mobile/tablet gaming I have witnessed and experienced its evolution from legacy phones Snake from Nokia up to its latest innovation in VR Gaming. I have experienced playing with VR couple of times using Samsung VR  and found it to have so much potential in revolutionizing the gaming and media industry. I tried to play Shironeko, Protocol Zero, Cosmos Warfare and watched some 360 flicks and photos. The experience will be useful in identifying lags / issues with newly developed VR apps or games.

Regardless of the project you would give to me, what I can assure you is that I am a dedicated team member, will work as your partner, will be concerned of your interests, will be very passionate on achieving your business goals.

Using my engineering modeling skills and product design intuition, I build and help others prototype ideas, all while evaluating iterative market & product development paths for the product design to become profitable. In addition, with over three years experience having worked with custom home builders, interior designers, and individual clients seeking new construction or remodels, I also specialize in 3D building design and rendering, 2D constuction documents for permit, HVAC & building oritentation analysis for better building energy performance, shop or production drawings for custom furniture and other products, furnished floor plans, floor plans to fit a building footprint, and other applicable engineering and architectural plans such as lighting plans and basic structural plans. Lastly, I am also a recording musician with a license to Pro Tools 8 and can provide sound and track editing services.

My main skills that I can use for our collaboration include:

- 3D model generation & analysis using AutoCAD, Inventor, REVIT, SketchUp Pro
- 3D model rendering & detail views using SketchUp Pro, Kerykythea, SU Podium
- 3D product and building animations using SketchUp, Key Frame Animation
- Floor plan & elevation design, site plan design, CD sets editing using AutoCAD.
- Building energy analysis using SkecthUp Pro, Flow Design, REVIT
- Patent drawings, production drawings, weld drawings using AutoCAD
- HVAC, plumbing optimization by calculating Manual J and custom spreadsheets
- HVAC and lighting design for residential and small commercial projects. 
- Solar photovoltaic system design, one line diagrams, solar consulting
- Product design and development to market

- Secondary market research and informational interviews
- Start up consulting and risk analysis using Excel templates
- Data analysis, data entry, template writing using Microsoft Excel
- Engineering reports and thesis entry using Microsoft Word
- Music track and sound editing and generation using Pro Tools 8 

Before modeling a product or building, I like to ask client's a series of questions to decipher their wants and needs for the design. Incorporating data gathered from client's expectations, I present different designs so that clients can provide additional feedback. Never do I charge for time in which I must self teach a concept or fix an error. Once a contract has begun, I respond to client's emails in less than 15 minutes unless after hours. I typically work from 9:00am to 5:00pm CT, but can shuffle time around and work extra if you are on a stict deadline. 

This paragraph is a little about me and my background. Following graduation from the University of Texas and before joining Upwork, I worked as a resident engineer-in-training for one and a half years in a sustainable home construction company. In addition, before joinging Upwork, I worked as an independent contractor with several clients. Projects completed during that time include creating and editing a 45 second animation for a vaccine administation device, modifing shop and weld drawings of a steel carport to fit a photovoltaic solar array, and creating proposals for rooftop solar power systems. While studying technology commercialization at the University of Texas, I conducted market research and co-authored a business plan , marketing strategy, and operations plan aimed at the commercializion of a Titanium Dioxide based coating to use as a non-invasive solar panel cleaning solution. I have a stoic passion for reducing humanity's carbon footprint. Whenever I am not occupied on Upwork, I am always watching you tube videos and furthering my expertise using Autodesk University, Autodesk Design Academy, you tube videos, and other outlets. My other passions include recording music, playing guitar, creating playlists, authoring my 3 digital magazines on flipboard, and working in the yard.

Thank you very much for reading this far and for checking out my profile. If you are interested in a non-committal talk, please let me know. I am always open to negotiations. I would love to work with you and see your vision come to reality!

I can set up your site from scratch or jump into an existing site needing changes. I can implement to your preferred specifications, or provide input and advice on how best to proceed. My goal is to provide you not with a basic website, but to help you evaluate and define your entire web presence. Yes, you end up with a website, but while creating that we look at ALL aspects of your business: How well does this site convey your brand? Does it provide a good platform for your marketing goals? How well is it optimized for both SEO (search-engine optimization) and user experience? Is your content both SEO optimized AND well-written for your users?

I'm a native English speaker with an extremely high technical skill level and over 20 years of website development experience. I am proficient in a variety of coding languages and protocols, with particular expertise in Wordpress, HTML, CSS, PHP, both MySQL/MSSQL databases, jQuery, and some SEO. I can provide graphic and photo services as well as design feedback. I also have a great deal of experience in writing and editing, both technical and non-technical materials. I am very good at communicating both with technicians/engineers and non-technical clients to translate needs and desires into workable engineering and web-based solutions.

I hold both a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a Master's Degree in Business Administration. I am organized, articulate, and responsible. Your projects will be completed professionally and to your complete satisfaction. Thank you for your consideration!

** Portfolio Note ** 
In the world of technology (and with websites in particular), it doesn't take long for a project to become outdated. I used to try to keep my portfolio updated with all of my projects, but as I began focusing more time on my clients' needs, it became too cumbersome.

============ AN EXPERT EDITOR FOR ALL YOUR PROJECTS ============

With my strong command of the Adobe Creative Cloud platform (Premiere Pro, Photoshop and After Effects, especially) and many other video editing tools (Camtasia and Sony Vegas are always popular), I can deliver consistent results across several different formats, including:

* Vlogs
* Salesvideos, promos and ads

* News videos
* Social media content

Not to mention my strong grasp on a myriad of fields, such as:

* Self-help and coaching
* Seduction, dating and lifestyle
* Cryptocurrency
* Finance and wealth
* Health and personal care

I can work with any video in any format up to 4K/30fps or 1080p/60fps.

============ A VERSATILE WORKER FOR ANY OCCASION ============

One of my strongest assets is my resourcefulness, which allows me to adapt to a wide range of situations, emergencies and requirements.

Need a last minute change? I'll be always here for you! You voice actor has gone sick and you've got no one to re-record that crucial part of the audio? I can arrange that to! Your video needs subtitles in a foreign language, but all good translators have suddenly vanished from the market? Well, you've got one multilingual editor to spare right here!

* I've got access to Videoblocks, one of the largest video libraries online. This will provide you with near-limitless options of stock footage for your projects, completely free of charge!

* Scriptwriting: I can write or copyedit scripts for your video on any occasion and on all of the topics listed above, plus several others I'm experienced at (video games, economics, politics, world history, film, literature and art, to list a few I've have worked with in the past);

* Translation services: I am a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker with fluency in both English and Spanish, so translations to-and-fro these languages are a breeze to me. I can also read and understand French and Italian clearly, allowing me to edit videos even on these languages;

* Voiceovers and voice-recording: if needed, I can provide good-quality voiceovers and narrations to your videos. My tone is neutral and stern, perfect for explainer videos and corporate promos.

I can deal with any workload under any deadline, provided good, clear communication is always established with the client. Speaking of that, I'm always available for contact, so you don't have to worry about sending a message and only receiving the answer the next day (or week, or never... O__O).

I've been a software entrepreneur three times and those experiences taught me how to transform a product from the early idea stage to an app with 5 star ratings. 

I can help you with multiple aspects of your project from considering the business case, to assisting with UX design, creating the UI assets, and developing the app.  I’ve built for both front-end and back-end, and I can set up servers to support apps with data, user management, background tasks, push notifications, text messages, cheap email campaigns, etc. 

Technically speaking, I have excellent knowledge of iOS and Python/Django, plus decent exposure to a broad set of supporting tools (+ a willingness to learn).

Here’s a little more about me: I’m the oldest of five Californian kids.  I’m based in San Francisco and have been in the Bay Area most of my life, though I spent some very formative years in LA as well.  I love to travel and I’ve been to 74 countries, including spending some time living abroad.  Maybe you can tell me where to go next!  

I have experience creating both iPhone applications and REST APIs from scratch to completion.  In addition, I have over 6 years work experience as a part of senior management in start-up companies and as a strategy consultant.

I’d be happy to meet with you and your team, and to work together on creating an amazing product.  I have a passion for building and improving, so I bring a lot of enthusiasm and energy to my work.  Looking forward to talking to you.

~ Bryan

1.	Precision and Sea-based Logistics System (PSL)	
The objective of this project is real-time monitoring of status of objects (such as vehicles). The project used several novel concepts such as condition monitoring, mobile agents, software ontology and distributed computing for real-time monitoring. The project spans around two years comprising various modules for health monitoring, situation awareness, work order management, real-time status tracking and decision making.

2.	Faults and Usage Management System (FUMS®)
The FUMS software allows a user to browse a remote vehicle's faults in real time, select a fault and troubleshoot the problem. For troubleshooting, the user browses the Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) using an IETM browsing software. The maintainer can order the parts to perform the real time maintenance of equipment and vehicles remotely. Maintainers can order parts, troubleshoot, and schedule maintenance from his/her office.

3.	Golf Swing Detection
This research project investigates different techniques for recognition of golf swings based on real-time accelerometer data. The project uses different techniques such as Hidden Markov Mode (HMM) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for training and classification of different golf swings. The tool allows visualizing accelerometer’s data, performing offline training and identifying starting and ending positions of different types of swing.

4.	Cross-Site Forgery Request (CSRF) protection
This is a chrome extension for protection against CSRF attacks. The extension analyses currently downloaded page for possible threats based on various novel techniques and notifies users about these threats.

5.	Human Resource Management System	 (HRMS®)
HRMS® is a complete web-based system for tracking human resources and management. HRMS® is an integral part of an organization for facilitating the strategic planning by providing modules for employee management, payroll and attendance in an organization. A separate component miTimecard® allows employees to enter time in and out from remote locations. HRMS® can be integrated with WOTS® and 3B® in an organization to provide a total picture.

6.	Autonomic progress monitoring system	
A mobile application for monitoring of progress of a remote site using pictures taken in auto/manual mode. Information about pictures (such as GPS, date time, site Id) are disseminated using web services that can be analyzed at server via animations and reports in real-time or offline mode

7.	Work order tracking system (WOTS®)	
A software tool to optimally manage, schedule and track organizational work orders. WOTS® schedules the work orders for optimal loadings of work centers. Then work order data is aggregated from the dispersed work centers to a centralized site. WOTS® provides web access to the collected data for analysis and reporting.

8.	Project Billing, Booking and Backlog (P3B®)
A software tool for plant managers and decision makers to view current and historical plant data in order to see in real time financial and order statuses. Plant managers can analyze, manage and search invoices, bookings and backlogged data. P3B® provides an autonomous data collection utility that imports the organizations data without user intervention. Management reports are generated automatically and emailed to identified stakeholders. P3B® provides a web based interface for viewing and searching data.

Areas of expertise:

✅ Facebook Advertising

CUSTOM STRATEGY 
I will analyze your business, crunch the numbers, determine your “sticking points,” and come up with a custom plan for maximizing leads and sales via Facebook ads. I will walk you through how to use Facebook ads to reach your IDEAL prospects and turn them into loyal customers. 

DONE-FOR-YOU

When you decide to let me handle your campaign, I will start creating direct response Facebook ads to drive qualified traffic, leads, and sales within 7 days. I will handle all the busy work while you focus on building your business.

STEADY STREAM

With your successful Facebook ad campaign, you’ll be able to generate a steady stream of leads and sales that skyrocket your revenue. You’ll be able to expand your reach in your market, build brand awareness, and tap into a predictable stream of highly targeted leads who consistently come back to you begging to buy.


✅ PPC (pay-per-click-marketing)

PPC advertising is the single fastest strategy to grow leads and sales FAST! However, it can be hard to make profits due to the high level of competition online. That’s why we don’t just optimize your PPC campaigns; we build high-converting landing pages to optimize your conversion rate and skyrocket profits from your PPC advertising.

✅ PPC PROFITABLE
Optimize for conversion, not clicks.
You may have run Google Adwords in the past and were left saying “Google AdWords doesn’t work for our business”. If this sounds familiar, the chances are you were either managing them yourself and burning cash – due to a lack of know-how – or had an amateur running it that simply looked at clicks and traffic, rather than conversions.

How am I different? I don’t just optimize your PPC campaigns for clicks, but also optimize your website conversion rate to ensure we’re converting as many browsers into buyer as possible – squeezing every last drop of value from your campaign, to make PPC profitable for your business.

✅ CRO (conversion-rate-optimization)

HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU LEAVING ON THE TABLE?

There is a lot of low-lying fruit within reach! I will show you how to double, even triple the number of leads and sales you get without spending more on advertising by just optimizing your website.

Proven fact: 
96% of websites visitors leave and never return again

COMPRESS DECADES INTO DAYS and get an unfair advantage…

I’ve run thousands of tests for my clients and invested over 10,000 hours into the science behind conversion. After years of doing this, you start to see patterns and understand exactly how people interact with websites and what drives them to take action. I work with you to identify what your ‘typical’ customers concerns and desires are and then use a mix of direct-response copywriting and world-class design to make as many of your websites visitors take the desired action we want.

I will provide website performance audit and you will receive an unfair advantage and slaughter the competition.


GET AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
and slaughter the competition

In the fiercely competitive world of business, where everyone is vying for a larger piece of the pie, Conversion Rate Optimisation is the single most important tactic for maximizing the return from your online marketing. Doubling your conversion rate alone, will double the number of leads and sales your business gets. Today, a website is the core of your business. If that core is twice as effective at turning potential customers into paying clients, every piece of marketing you do will yield twice the results. 

These results affect every aspect of your business and have a profound effect. If your website converts more browsers into buyers than any of your competitors' sites, you can also afford to attract more traffic than anyone else in your market – allowing you to steal market share while others panic.

✅ SEO (search-engine-optimization)

GUARANTEED GOOGLE RANKINGS IN 90 DAYS OR FULL REFUND. 
Don’t waste your time with promises when you can see our proven results. There is no-risk offer will get you on page one of Google in 90 days* or I will work for FREE!

I WILL MAKE YOU MORE MONEY
…and skyrocket profits
Most SEO experts have it all wrong! They focus on rankings, not revenue. Rankings and traffic are great, but if those visitors don’t convert into actual dollars, it doesn’t matter. All I care about is how much revenue and profit I can drive to your business.

What you get when you hire me: 

1. Attention to robust, scalable, and performant architecture: My experience and focus on proven architectures and design patterns enables me to build systems that are robust, performant, and scalable complexity-wise as more components are added, saving you money.

2. Pragmatic problem-solving: I am always curious and learning to find better ways to do things; this outlook, combined with my wide experience with different technologies, helps me to be effective at researching and implementing pragmatic solutions to challenges I face, technical or otherwise.

3. Good communication skills: I understand the importance of communication in a team, and I have excellent skills to match: I have documented enterprise software projects, taught engineering communication courses, and re-searched and written technical papers and articles.

4. Effective UX: Based on my training and experience, I approach UX as an intrinsic part of effective design as a whole, not as something tacked on after back-end development. This perspective has been effective in my work.

I have more than 20 passed tests in Upwork, and my language-related knowledge includes being fluent in English (Duolingo Proficiency Exam successfully passed with 10/10), and a native Spanish speaker, I can efficiently translate between that pair of languages. I'm backed by a wide experience of more than 200 successful jobs in Upwork. Many of these jobs are related to apps and websites, so I can work with almost any file extension (DOCs, TXTs, POs, HTMLs, XMLs, and any kind of strings). Apart from that, I am an amateur writer with more than 15 texts published, and experienced in this platform with content writing and article writing jobs. I also have knowledge about programming, in Visual Basic and Visual Basic .NET. Among my hobbies, I'm a huge football (soccer) fan, I own a Facebook Fan Page called Mensajes de Buenos Aires (10,000+ likes) in which I publish phrases painted as graffitis in the streets of my city. As a proof of my knowledge, you can find my passed tests in Upwork and also my Duolingo certificate below.

I've participated in the first Exclusive Top Rated Freelancer Meetup with Upwork, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October 24th, 2015, where I met Upwork's staff members and other freelancers from the area and improved my skills.

I went to the Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, one of the most important highschools in Argentina. Studied English at the Asociación Argentina de Cultura Inglesa (AACI). Currently studying Political Science at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), renowned college from Latin America.

I aim to work on interesting jobs and tasks that require my knowledge about languages, but also in those that aren't very complex or tricky; I'm highly efficient working on simple texts (for example from apps, websites, software, articles, books, blogs and related) and that is my main preference when taking and applying to a job.

I will always turn around good quality work, within the defined deadline, and I'm open to comments, questions and critics everytime. I'm a very reliable, responsible, dedicated, experienced and comprehensive person, also when comes to personal difficulties, and I expect the same from my clients.

I'm proud to say that thanks to Upwork I was able to be the official Spanish translator for Chatous, Kiwi Q&A, Crossfader, and Geozilla, among many other apps, also blogger for HoyEnTec, and data input manager at Jot Internet Media S.L. I'm also part of the Translation Tower's agency team since June 2016.

As the Merchant of Words, I’m not related to the Merchant of Venice.

To be honest, Shakespeare never appealed to me. Neither did academics. Thus, I just about managed to complete my schooling – or let’s just say that my teachers got fed up of me. After all, I was an immense strain on their conscience. It couldn’t have been easy deciding where I deserved fractional marks for an answer i.e. a 0.3 here or a 0.6 there etc., could it? Suffice it to say that my academic success in school resembled a village after a Mongol raid.

A few years later, I began working as a software developer. In that time, I learnt that I could create software for an accounting system. Considering that all I knew about accounting was the definition of debit and credit, it was an educational achievement on the job. I also learned how to travel to various parts of the city. An online job that taught me several offline things!

Later, I found myself applying for an executive position to answer e-mail queries sent by Amazon.com’s customers. However, the powers that were thought I was a glutton for punishment. Therefore, they made me a Quality Editor instead. I handled the responses for the escalation e-mail queues. I also trained and audited e-mail responses for 15 executives. A relocation ended this brief but enlightening dalliance. 

My next assignment was as a back office executive in insurance processing. I processed transactions related to insurance cover. In some time, my supervisors realised that my innocent smiles (certainly not my good looks!) lay behind all their troubles. So they gave me charge of a team, of a process and of a client relationship too. From indexing scanned images of insurance claims related post to recovering money from at-fault third parties, my team did it all. Sadly, they also did me in… I finally turned to becoming a freelance content developer: writing about things I hadn’t heard of or seen, for clients I hadn’t ever seen (or ever would, for that matter!) at places I didn’t even know existed. 

After such an extensive background, can I really write? Well, in over 16 years of experience that is the only thing I’ve done. See how:
•	As a software developer, I WROTE computer programs and manuals
•	As a quality editor, I WROTE e-mails and responses
•	As an executive in back office processing, I WROTE manuals, desktop procedures and white papers
•	As a team leader, I WROTE policies, manuals, emails, white papers etc.
•	As a content developer, I WRITE articles, blogs, website content, product descriptions etc.

So what’s common across: softWare – auditOr – data-entRy – team leaDer and writing Stuff fulltime?

The answer is simple: All of them deal in WORDS…that express what needs to be done in the best way possible… less","India"

Choosing the right words is how you progress from being one of many to being ""the one."" Knowing how to express yourself to your market is what separates you from the competition. Words must have purpose. Whether it's SEO, social media, web content, articles and blogs, your content will never have one word too few or one word too many. 

Instead of you taking the focus away from your products and services to write your own web content, articles, blogs, and other collateral, let me handle that. As a writer educated at Boston University with millions of dollars in sales resulting from copy I've written, my job is making sure that every word in your copy is meticulously chosen to ensure your success. 

I engage your readers so they don't feel like they're being sold a product, but instead they're getting information about something that will provide an enhanced quality of life. Authenticity is the key - there's no smarm, cliche, or cheese - your prospects will read your content while feeling respected and in turn, are more likely to follow the call to action.

Of course, all the writing basics are followed - understanding pain points, positioning, etc. 

Bottom line - my goal is your success, I have your back.

One reason why my work is very good is that I enjoy it and would rather invest a bit more effort than deliver a mediocre result. 
You will always notice that I care for any work I do because I will never just brush over a ambiguity without taking care to choose the right word, I will get to know your product or project and I will ask for clarification or give you alternatives to use to save time.
I understand texts before I translate them, I understand and research a topic before I write a text and I also take care to understand your requirements before I start the work. That is why you can also always ask questions about my work or how to integrate it into your project and be sure to get a helpful and competent answer. 

I am able to work to clear instructions or help you find out what you need. For your online marketing I combine understanding of computer science with regard to search engines (SEO)  and experience and knowledge about the preparation of texts for human readers.

I have more than ten years experience in freelance work and am used to working flexibel times, meeting deadlines and adapting to different format requirements. I can deliver my work in most formats and with most programs you could wish for - including but not limited to Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, LaTeX or InDesign.

I enjoy(ed) a broad education and while linguistics and computer science (especially logic) are my main areas of expertise I am also conversant with literature, psychology, medicine, (german) law, mathematics, history, religions and certain areas of finance. This knowledge and the trained ability to get into a new field very quickly enable me to deliver high quality texts about many different topics.

Former projects in the area of language, marketing and websites include:
- Developing concepts and content for companies who wanted to start or improve and extend their online presence,
- Consulting on developing a German online presence for companies who already have a strong English strategy,
- SEO-oriented blog posts, marketing texts and website content in German - planning and writing as needed,
- translating (and setting) presentations for marketing presentations, psychology classes and advanced training
- translating papers and applications for research projects, 
- translating technical descriptions, websites or manuals,
- writing or proofreading commercial texts (from advertising to expert's reports), 
- and just adapting a written text to fit a certain tone of voice or style. less","Germany"

Thank you for viewing my profile and considering me for your project.

I have written six bestselling books, all of them published by traditional mainstream publishers through my literary agent, and I have edited two bestselling books, including one published by Simon & Schuster.

My most recent book, ""Cards for Brianna,"" written with a woman who died of metastatic breast cancer, was published by Sourcebooks in 2016, and was a #1 bestseller on Amazon. It has been printed in four languages.

Most of my editing work, more than 150 jobs, has been on Elance (before they required us to move to Upwork at the end of 2015). While on Elance, I ranked in the top 0.1% among all freelancers, and I am already a ""Top Rated"" editor on Upwork.

I have edited a wide range of other projects for Elance and Upwork clients worldwide, including:

Self-help books 
Business/marketing books 
Healthy living books 
Financial books 
Travel books 
Spiritual books 
Children's books 
Fictional short stories 
Magazine articles 
Websites 
College application/scholarship essays 
Phone apps 
Blog posts 
Business letters 
Press releases 

I am a former writer and editor with the Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper. I worked there for 10 years before leaving in 2013 to be a full-time author and freelance editor. The books I have written, which you can find on Amazon, are:

""I Choose to be Happy: A School Shooting Survivor's Triumph over Tragedy."" Written with Missy Jenkins Smith, it was featured on CNN, Anderson Cooper Live and Ricki Lake; 

""Angel in the Rubble: The Miraculous Rescue of 9/11's Last Survivor."" Written with Genelle Guzman-McMillan and published by Simon & Schuster, it was featured on NBC's 9/11 10th anniversary special and was published in four countries; 

""Finding Peace Amid the Chaos: My Escape from Depression and Suicide."" Written with Tanya Brown, the youngest sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, it has been featured in People Magazine and on CNN, Katie, Larry King Now and Huffington Post. 

""Expect the Unexpected: Bringing Peace, Healing, and Hope from the Other Side,"" with Bill Philipps, published by New World Library in San Francisco. 

""The Doctor Will See You Now: Recognizing and Treating Endometriosis,"" with Tamer Seckin, MD. The book was released in 2016. The foreword was written by Padma Lakshmi. 

""Cards for Brianna: A Mom's Messages of Living, Laughing, and Loving as Time Is Running Out,"" with Heather McManamy, who died of metastatic breast cancer.

If you're interested in me putting my 25 years of editing/writing experience to work for you, I'd love to hear from you!

1-   a customized ""business-specific"" Table of Contents  
2-  a unique ""Key Business Questions Answered"" page
3-  a well-reasoned Executive Summary featuring the most salient business metrics 

What I can bring to the table is the investor's viewpoint. Since investors like myself value ""margins of safety"", conservative financial exhibits are best. ABC/CNBC's ""Shark Tank"" or ""The Profit"" fairly depicts the key investment issues: How much does it cost to operate? What price can be charged? How many units have been sold? What unique advantage do you have? How will new capital be used?

I am a Science Graduate having almost 7 years of experience as a writer, which includes copywriting, blogging, Tech blog writing, newsletters, Press Releases and sales sheets writing experience, along with marketing communications and gimmicks. I worked as a freelance writer for a big company which serves for data storage and video surveillance business verticals. I helped them improve their market share by improving their online presence through my writing and marketing techniques. I am experienced in writing compelling, SEO friendly, promotional and appropriate content for blogs, email blasts, tweets, and Facebook posts. 

Apart from writing, I am also experienced in improving Social Media Marketing, Email Marketing, and Brand Development---all thanks to the experience acquired from my previous job. 

I am also fluent in Telugu and Hindi language and can easily take a Telugu or Hindi text and craft a parallel copy in English targeting US, UK, Canada, and/or Australian audiences.

The right words don’t always come easily or quickly. If they did, you wouldn’t be searching for a professional writer. Excellent writing is more than stringing words together. It’s a complex process that requires creativity, skill, and dedication among other qualities.

Your message may make sense to you, but not to someone who doesn’t know your industry, speaks ESL, or has a different learning style. I strive to make all of your writing as universally understandable as possible while still capturing the flavor of your brand. I also write primarily for humans and add a healthy dose of SEO so you can stand out from the glut of mediocre content on the internet.

When you work with me, you add not a wageworker but a strategic partner to your team. If I see an error on your website or book cover that needs urgent correction, I’ll let you know. If we can choose better images or simplify your procedures, I’ll let you know that too. But if something's getting the results you want, we won't change a thing. Instead of wearing blinders, I look at the big picture to ensure consistency and quality.

Value. Ethics. Communication. Eight years of experience. Commitment to getting it right. Contact me today to find out how I can help your business grow!

""The publisher just called... we smashed the Australian pre-order book record. More than Harry Potter! Thanks for helping me make history.""
 - Scott Pape (Australian #1 bestselling author)

""Finally! A real copywriter who knows what he's doing. Daniel's worth every penny and is a true professional.""
 - Peter K., 7-figure business operator

IF YOUR ONLINE BUSINESS GENERATES MORE THAN $200K A YEAR...

Then repeat after me: 

""At my level, it’s worth getting a professional to do my sales copy"".

The problem is, you're on Upwork. Which isn't really known for... well, you know... good copy.

So if you're turning over a healthy 6 figures, and you're looking for a world-class sales page... where do you go?

That's where I can help.

My name's Daniel, and unlike 99% of sales copywriters on Upwork, I focus on ONE thing: high-converting sales pages for online businesses.

And by doing that, I can write you a better page than anyone on this site.

A big claim? Yeah. But trust me—I’ve been here a while, and I've seen most of the competition.

It's not too hard to spot a rookie writer:

✔ Telling you about how they'll ""connect"" with your audience... when their OWN PROFILE is so dull it nearly puts you into a coma.

✔ 'Specialising' in every kind of copy under the sun: VSLs, sales pages, blog posts, emails, etc. (Guys... I don't think that's what the word means.)

✔ A rate of $125/hr... and a job history at $20/hr. HA! Nice try! (Mine's full of clients who pay top dollar—and LOVE the results.)

✔ Boasting about how they 'get' the difference between 'features' vs. 'benefits'. (If that wows you, you aren't ready to hire me.)

You get the picture!

OK, now let’s get serious: 

If you’re at the point where a few extra sales for your course or services are going to mean thousands of dollars… you KNOW good copy is worth investing in.

So... why can you trust ME to do it?

Well, firstly... my results. Aside from my reviews, which speak for themselves, I've:

* Crafted a multi-million dollar sales funnel (that raked in $2,246,508 in 5 days)
* Raised US$108,000 with one Kickstarter script
* Crushed the Australian pre-order record with a #1 bestselling book sales launch—then broke it again with another
* Won I Will Teach You To Be Rich's first copywriting contest

What’s more, if I choose to work with you, you can expect a slightly unusual approach:

✗ NO GUESSWORK. Every project starts with research into your email list, and understanding exactly what they want. I do this well—it’s my secret sauce.

✗ NO EGO. Most writers get offended if you touch a word of their copy. But in online businesses, your brand voice matters! That’s why I welcome your feedback to help make it “sound like you”.

✗ NO CRAZY CLAIMS. Contrary to many eager rookies, pros know that even the best copy can’t do the job alone. You need a good list and a good offer (and I’ll ask for proof before I work with you).

But hey. This is all just talk, right? 

OK, how about this: if you didn’t realise... you’re still reading a page of MY copy right now. (If you thought YOU decided to read on—well, that’s exactly my point!)

So if you’re interested, here’s what I want you to do:

1. Check out my testimonials and portfolio below (log in to see my best work). Seriously, do it before you contact me. See for yourself that I’m the real deal—people pay me good money and love the results.

2. Next, take my checklist above, and test your other options on Upwork. See if you can find any other writers who can produce proof of good, solid sales copy like mine. (And careful: tons of freelancers rip off my profile, because I've done so well. ALWAYS ask for samples.)

3. Finally... you can send me an offer. 

Look, I'm confident you won't find a better sales copywriter on Upwork.

But if you’re sold on me—hold on a sec.

Before you go ahead and offer me a job—as many people do every week—you need to know something: I am SUPER busy.

I work full-time with some big-name clients, and I have a baby boy... meaning my time is scarce.

So here's the rub.

If your offer is for less than my DAY rate of $1,500—and a one day minimum—I’ll decline it.

If you can't wait at least 2 weeks for me to start, I'll decline it.

And if you don't include testimonials or proof that your product is ethical and awesome, I’ll decline it.

No, this isn’t a gimmick. And it's not that I'm a jerk.

It's just that if you qualify as my client, you get my absolute best... and so right now I'm flat out, helping my current clients make millions and change lives.

Now remember, I can make YOU millions, and help YOU change lives. I'm easily worth it.

But if you want my help, you’re gonna have to convince me you are, too.

Still keen? 

Send me an offer... and give it your best shot.

More than 10 years of experience in developing .NET solutions; while started coding in 1995 using Java.

I have been working with .NET Framework just from its initial release in February 2002. On the second thought, my acquaintance with .NET started even earlier — from developing apps on Java while I was yet doing my Master’s degree in Mathematics & Computer Science. .NET Framework’s idea is actually very similar to the one Java is based on.

Programming on a commercial basis since 1998, I’ve worked with clients from all over the world — Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the US and Canada.

A fair amount of the solutions we’ve created together, are those, I’m infinitely proud of. These are, for instance:
— A system, helping to save people’s lives through automating an ambulance service’s work.
— A solution, used by plumbing businesses across a whole continent, which streamlines these businesses’ workflows and dramatically reduces paperwork.
— А printing business ERP, which has helped this business to grow dozens of times.
— A mobile app, being ranked the number one video editing app for several mobile platforms.
— And many more.

Started programming for my own pleasure, I kept doing it while studying at the university, and, finally, in 1998, I founded Hirerussians by inviting two friends to join me in developing software solutions on demand.

Here we are, HireRussians, in 2010s, consisting of 150 specialists. Among our IT professionals each meets my rigorous requirements to the level of his tech competence, possesses an ability to feel responsible on what he does, and even shares such values as vivacity and the desire to enhance the world around.

Our Headquarters are located in Akademgorodok, the scientific center of Novosibirsk, not far away from Novosibirsk State University — since we have a soft spot for hiring the best graduates from it’s Math, Computer Science and Physics departments.

Either you need a solution on .NET, or still doubt, what to choose — Microsoft or open source, web, mobile or desktop, contact us and we’ll give you a free consultation. Every particular task requires its own approach, and, since we have it all —.NET, PHP, Java, C++, Front-end and Mobile teams, we, at HireRussians, are no prejudiced in choosing the technology stack and would offer you the most appropriate one.

My personal core technology stack includes the following:

.NET Framework, C#, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WebAPI2, ASP.NET WebForms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), WinForms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), WinRT, WinJS, Windows Phone, Xamarin, Entities Framework, ADO.NET, MS SQL Server, Kendo/Telerik, DevExpress less","Russia"

""Lots of people wrote ""this guy rocks"". And that is simply true. Ruediger is extremely smart and clear and the quality is extraordinary."" 
- a Client @upwork (just check my project history to see more of them)

I help companies to collect unstructured data from the web and transform it into clean, structured and actionable data – by building scraping systems running on the client’s servers or just delivering the data (data as a service / data on demand).

I'm a responsible and dedicated professional, delivering on time and within budget.  (just check out the feedback on my projects ... and I'm also active outside of upwork/elance alot)

“Ruediger has performed an outstanding job for us. He demonstrates a great deal of professionalism and technical excellence. I strongly endorse him without reservation!”
- a Client @upwork

That's why I can guarantee results: you are satisfied or you pay nothing. Period.

What I can do for you:

1. Scraping unstructured data from websites, online directories, web archives etc for Research and Data Acquisition

2. Building systems for market intelligence that scan websites continuously for changes in price, product listings, etc … in almost any market imaginable (I’ve seen and built such projects for retailers, in real estate, building equipment and some more)

3. Extracting data for Lead Enrichment and Lead Generation - improve your marketing efforts with data that’s available on the web

4. Anything else data and web automation related that comes to your mind – invite me to your project and we can discuss what can be done.

You need me, if:

- you have complex data that needs intense restructuring and cleanup
- you need the data prepared and imported into database structures ranging from MySQL to complex Hadoop or Spark clusters
- the data is highly unstructured and requires the use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Deep Learning algorithms for cleanup and restructuring
- the data source is difficult to scrape and others have failed already

Your benefits of working with me: 

1. Open communication: you will receive project updates from me at least once a week, if necessary even daily. In the rare cases when problems come up I will tell you openly and you'll never see me disappear (I'm still astounded that this is a common problem with other freelancers)

2. Quick turnaround times and reliable, complete and accurate results ensured by me using Python and the scrapy framework (that's my strong recommendation if technology can be choosen freely)

3. There's little that can stop me: anti scraping mechanisms (captchas, bandwidth throttling, IP banning) are easily overcome using a network of 3000+ proxy servers, the tor network plus my lateral thinking and well grounded education in computer science

4. Messy or strangely coded data is no problem as I'll clean it using my data mining experience plus OCR automation to handle data that's hidden in images (like emails in many business directories)

5. Top Secret: If required, I'll stay stealthy while scraping for you using my network of proxies or the infamous Tor network - as a result your scraping project won't ring your competitions' alarm bells and won't give away what your plans are

Sounds interesting? Just invite me to your job posting. less","Germany"

I’ve worked in many types of environments including academic, healthcare, non profits, market research, public health, government, software, small biz/start up, and large corporate (as well as food service, dry cleaning, pharmacy, delivery person, personal assistant, etc). I’ve consulted for a bunch of academic institutions and for-profit and non-profit organizations, including the National Park Service, the National Park Foundation, UC Berkeley, Stanford University and Hospital, UCSF, UCLA, the Neuropsychiatric Institute at UCLA, and the Pediatric Pain Program at the UCLA Hospital. I love big ideas and providing the structure around them to ensure their realization. I’m also a big fan of using the amazing technologies and networks that we have to connect ourselves and help support each other in enriching (and fun!) ways.

Kia Ora! My name is Ryan. I am from New Zealand – have been in the digital marketing game for 5 years. Yes I like the All Blacks. Yes I like the Haka.

You won't find me focusing on 'clicks' - they don't make money. I optimise campaigns towards business goals. 

I A/B split test my way to my customers hearts - be it landing pages or ad copy. Know how to deploy complex Google Analytics environments, can mock up a highly functional conversion oriented landing page  - and can create a Google Shopping campaign that makes you wonder why you weren't working with me sooner! 

Some PPC campaigns are in dire need of a sharp landing page that can turn visitors in to qualified leads - so I also create direct response based landing page that complement my PPC package.

If a landing page is too minimal, and an overall web experience is what you are looking for - I create mobile friendly and SEO compliant Wordpress websites for a fraction of the price that you would pay for at an agency. 

Take a look at my portfolio below to see what I do for my customers!

A little more about me:
I have 19 years experience, including 15 years working for national and international newspapers including 11 years as senior Infographic designer with The Daily Mail and 3 as senior Infographic designer with The Economist in London.

I have completed many freelance jobs here on upWork successfully. I have also recently completed an infographic for BAE Systems and others ,via international Communication firm Golin Harris, for Texas Instruments, WorldPay and Flora margarine.
I am English so naturally I speak and write perfect English.

I have an extensive knowledge of information graphics including charts, diagrams and maps.
In my most recent job, before going freelance, as Senior Infographic Designer at The Daily Mail newspaper I worked closely with reporters developing infographics from editorial copy often using my own ideas, sometimes from ideas scrawled in biro on scraps of paper by the reporter.  All finished work was expected to be of the highest quality. I am used to trying to second guess what is required in a graphic.

I am used to working to very tight deadlines but also taking more time over a more involved job.

The thing for which I am most proud during my time with The Daily Mail is evolving their City and Finance graphics from simple blue boxes into exciting yet clear infographics often capable of holding up a page.

I am equipped with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop CC and MS Office.

I would like very much to talk/message/email with you about any infographic project you would be interested in me undertaking for you.

Hello there, 
My name is Aimi. I used to work at Apple Inc. as a bilingual data analyst (Japanese/English), and now I am fully focusing on Freelance as my full-time job! My main job currently is translation and digital marketing.

A little more details about myself: I have worked in both Japanese and other American corporations for over 3 years. Every company that I worked for including IT, pharmaceuticals, retails, designing, and educational institutions required Japanese and English translations of documents as well as in-person. My work was published in public and supported customers to understand effectively. 

I was born and raised in Japan, and my higher educations have been in the United States.
I graduated with a Master of Science in Business Management from Southern Methodist University in addition to B.A. in International Studies at Portland State University, which required strong research writing skills. I have been consistently writing essays, providing business analysis and market research, and sharing Japanese culture. Thus, proofreading and developing resumes is another strength for me.

✔️ Accuracy, clarity and attention to detail 
✔️ Prompt and straightforward communication 
✔️ A quick turnaround without compromising on quality

Contact me and I'll ensure that your text is as perfect as possible. 
Isabelle Anne Abraham

=== SERVICE DESCRIPTION ===

1. I'll first take a look at your document to determine which level of editing it requires:

🔸 Proofreading (polishing)
Before your writing is published, it needs a final review—beyond a simple spellcheck. I’ll correct typographical errors (typos/misprints) as well as formatting errors in spacing, headings, page numbers, captions, table of contents, footnotes, etc. I'll double-check design elements, and if specified, I’ll also ensure that the text conforms to a style guide.

🔸 Copy-editing (improving)
This is “light editing” and usually what most people require. I’ll correct spelling, grammar, punctuation and problems with syntax / sentence structure. I’ll also check for consistency in style and tone, making sure that the text is concise and flows smoothly.

🔸 Heavy editing (overhauling)
Others refer to this as “line editing,” “content editing,” or ""substantive editing."" Whatever you want to call it, this includes any or all of the following: heavy editing, rewording, and structural editing. I also check for ambiguities, repetitiveness, inappropriate diction, etc. Although I don't offer complete rewrites, I can rephrase where necessary—while maintaining your voice and keeping your target reader in mind. 

2. Select a style guide to be applied to your text: 

• Associated Press Stylebook (AP 2017)
• Chicago Manual of Style (CMoS 17th ed.)
• In-house style guide (if you have one)
• New Oxford Style Manual (2016)
• Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA 6th ed.)

3. Choose American English or British English. I've worked with both throughout my life, so either can be used for your specific audience.

4. Pick a platform on which you'd like me to work:

• MS Word (using Track Changes if requested), Excel or PowerPoint
• A basic text editor like Notepad
• Google Docs (using Suggestions mode if requested)
• Adobe Acrobat Reader (using the Comment tools)
• Directly in your CMS (Squarespace, Weebly, Wix, WordPress)
• Print, correct and scan (for an extra fee)

=== WORK TERMS ===

• I'm available for up to 10 hours a week, including weekends if necessary.
• Urgent deadlines can be prioritized—preferably with advance notice.
• I can work on both short- and long-term projects, with individuals or teams. 
• Confidentiality is guaranteed; I'm willing to sign an NDA before commencing the work.
• I prefer communicating through Upwork, email or online collaboration tools (Basecamp, Slack, Trello, etc.).

=== PROOFREADING & EDITING BACKGROUND + PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ===

I’m a native-English speaker and have always been interested in the written word. I started proofreading and editing in middle school, where I would check my friends’ homework for errors before they submitted it to the teacher. 

I earned my Bachelor of Journalism from Rhodes University in South Africa, where I specialized in Writing & Editing, majored in English Literature, and took a course in English Language & Linguistics. Additionally, I was part of the campus newspaper's editorial team as a chief sub-editor and subsequently deputy editor-in-chief.

Since then, I've collaborated with numerous authors, businesses and other professionals to make their writing as flawless as it can be. The variety of projects that I've worked on includes:

• Catalogs, flyers, emails and letters
• Scientific articles and technical reports
• Federal government bids and grant proposals
• Academic papers (essays, dissertations, theses, etc.)
• Mobile apps, video scripts, online courses and card games
• Legal documents such as contracts and patent applications
• Translations and texts written by non-native English speakers
• Blogs, news articles, website content and marketing materials
• Non-fiction ebooks and printed books, as well as children’s books
• Business plans & presentations, pitch decks, white papers and case studies
• CVs/resumes, cover letters, personal statements and other application supplements

===  ADDITIONAL EDITORIAL SERVICES === 

• Content management: managing publishing schedules; assigning content to writers and providing them with feedback
• Style guide development: creating an in-house style guide or improving/expanding an existing one 
• Search engine optimization in WordPress: adding sub-headings, titles, tags, image texts, meta description, focus keyword; improving SEO and Readability score
• Writing: articles and blog content (with attribution)
• Transcribing: verbatim or edited transcripts for a range of English accents less","Mozambique"

""I want to give six stars!!!""

Thanks for taking the time to look at my profile.

My name is Simon, and I'm a 46-year-old native British freelance copywriter and content writer, as well as a husband, and dad-of-two.  My clients hire me for my quality, research-based writing, my SEO awareness, attention to detail and professionalism.

I'm a UK law graduate (1993) and I've worked in a number of sectors at managerial and director level including: financial services, B2B sales and marketing, and events and exhibition organization. All of these roles have involved using the written and spoken word to persuade, educate, explain and impress.

Since entering early-retirement I've also rediscovered a love of less formal communication - and through my successful YouTube hobby-related channel (over 19,000 subscribers and 3.5M views in 2.5 years) I am able to entertain a niche consumer audience and grow a channel thanks to great titles, descriptions and keyword writing. 

Some of my strengths are:
- honesty and transparency;
- excellent written and spoken English;
- accuracy and an eye for detail;
- great, fluent writing with your target audience in sharp focus, whilst mindful of SEO;
- an understanding of the sales process and calls to action.

Someone once told me ""there's a reason the phrase 'content is king' is a cliché..."" and I think that's very true. Writing for your site should focus squarely on your prospects or customers. It's no good just writing for the search engines... they don't buy your stuff!

I will consider all writing projects (subject to my availability). Previous work has included:
- writing persuasive product descriptions for retail websites;
- copyediting and proofreading content from non-native speakers to ensure it is not only grammatically correct, but also reads naturally to native speakers.
- writing engaging articles for blogs, websites and mailing lists to add value to your site, including research;
- writing relevant SEO-friendly titles and descriptions for YouTube videos or other social media posts;
- writing static content for websites to entertain, describe, explain, and sell.

My rates include the time to research your project and niche properly. This is why I am able to write on topics as diverse as travel, finance, industrial machinery and yoga. Anyone who doesn't charge you for their research time is either not doing any research, or doing it badly!

I look forward to learning more about your project. less","United Kingdom"

His life goals include deadlifting twice his body weight, owning the complete twenty volume Oxford English Dictionary, and writing more than Didymus Chalcenterus.

I’m a web/mobile developer and developed my first program 22 years ago when I was 10 :). Also, I’m a tech leader of outsourcing software company. With my team, I have developed more than 100 projects over the last 5 years. 

I’m good at formalizing business requirements into working solutions with clean commented code covered with tests. I have strong fundamental skills in the computer science field, country-level programming contests won and tons of real-life development experience.

I aim to create products for people, and I do care about real use cases and UI. For example, I have developed “German Tinder,” educational social network for the University of North Carolina, an E-commerce platform for Canadian medicine provider and many other projects that are used by thousands of people.

My expertise lies in both MEAN and LAMP stack development. I love API-first paradigm with React/Angular/Redux on the frontend, PHP/Node for the backend for complex interface rich apps.  Also, I’m ok creating classy PHP/SQL web apps that output HTML right from the backend.

My focus for business development is to find the best tool for the job, either an existing service or one I build myself. The tool can be a small plain PHP script or large modular MVC app based on Laravel/Symfony. Whatever gets the job done!

Today I’m willing to take a new feature-rich and exciting project. Besides me, I have more than 50 employees on my team, including PM’s to handle the development process smoothly. Especially I would love to work with BigData or projects requiring hard skills in math or biology. For example, I’ve developed a math engine for casino slot machines, a social network for animal breeders where genetics knowledge was in use or did a cryptocurrency stock exchange simulation app.

So, how about a chat or call about your next project? ;-) less","Ukraine"

Students are also assisted for helping them to write college applications for further studies.

I am an experienced iOS software engineer, and I've been working in Swift since the day it was released. My primary focus is building iOS apps in Swift and Objective-C. I love nothing more than designing a good, solid foundation for an app and then building it up! 

Over 6 years experience in mobile application development including iOS and Android based native and cross platform mobile application development. The rich exposure across various industry verticals helped in polishing my skills in following areas

1. iOS Apps Development (iPad, iPhone), Objective C, Swift, Cocoa, XCode and Android Apps Development (mobile, tablets), Java, Kotlin.
2. Cross Platform application development using React Native. 
3. Google Map API and development of Location based mobile apps.
4. Social Networking apps and their interaction with PHP/.NET based webservices.
5. Video/Audio streaming and editing apps.
6. Deep Integration of social media APIs such as Facebook, Linkedin, Google or Twitter etc.
7. Integration of the third party SDK such as GoogleAdmob, iAd, Adwhirl, Revmob, Urban Airship, Flurry, Google Analytics etc.
8. Push Notification by using APNS and C2DM.
9. In-App purchases.
10. NFC Tech (QR and Barcode scanning by using Zxing and RedLaiser) and MDM (Mobile Device Management).
11. Photo Sharing and Image Processing apps.
12. Network Communication and Database programming using SQLite.
13 ARkit based apps.
14 Sinch based video and audio call and messaging.
15 Firebase integration based apps.
16 Beacon integration of both iBeacon and eddystone using estimate. Also we worked on the broadcasting of beacons from phone as well.


My iOS skills include:
• Deep learning. Ever since Apple introduced CoreML, I've gotten quite skilled at training and efficiently implementing on-device neural networks to do all sorts of tasks such as image recognition, handwriting recognition, ARKit and so on.
• Animation and design: From simple swipe-based animations to complex GPU accelerated animation.
• Location Services: I have years of experience working with GPS data and Apple’s Location Services framework.
• Maps: I have had 5+ years of experience with both Google’s Maps SDK and Apple’s MapKit. Mapping (cartography) is actually quite an interesting and extensive field, but it can also be really fun and rewarding. In one app I worked on called Doozyrama, I built a map with a tile-layer on top (like a fog), and whenever the user moved around the city it would clear out tiles to show where they went. It was quite a challenge to make it fast, and involved a lot of fundamental computer science techniques and efficient data structures.
• Advanced computation techniques: Techniques such as SIMD, multi-threading, GPU acceleration, and smart data structures can do remarkable things when implemented right. This is often one of the areas where iOS developers tend to fail, because if an algorithm isn't designed and tested right, it can cripple an app.
• Core Data, Realm: I have years of experience with Core Data, however in recent years I've started to greatly prefer using Realm DB instead. Core Data is quite old at this point and requires a ton of boilerplate code that can be difficult to maintain, Realm is significantly simpler and faster.
• Security: This is often a highly overlooked factor, and it has never been more important. Simple security techniques such as HTTPS, secure password hashing, and encryption can be easily implemented to make an app secure.

We always stay up to date to recent technologies across all the platforms. And always work with the latest versions of software to give the best experience to our clients. less","India"

Website Content
We have you fill out a comprehensive and thought-provoking questionnaire so that by the time we finish reviewing it we know exactly why you stand apart from your competitors.  Once we understand that, we are able to write a clear and concise message on every page.

Article Writing
The difference between article writing and blog posts is really the number of words and the overall tone of the writing. In other words, if you need to build trust and credibility on your website, it helps to include several well-researched​ articles about your expertise. This conveys authority and a level of seriousness in the style of writing.

Blog Posts
While blog posts can be informative (like articles), there’s an overall goal to connect more with your audience. This is a chance to show your personality and sense of humor (or not) and give a snippet of the culture behind your business. Blog posts are more “shareable” than articles and usually are presented in list format, quick tips, etc. less","United States"

Beyond your resume, LinkedIn, cover letter... you want more in life.

You’re hungry to get to the next level in your career – you KNOW you’re meant for more – but you aren't getting the job search results you want.

You want to wake up each day excited to go to work at a job you’ve dreamed about (okay, maybe not as starting point guard for the Lakers, but close enough).

Now, you need an expert resume writer & LinkedIn optimizer who can take you from where you are to where you want to be -- as quickly as possible.

Specializing in tech, digital marketing, finance/investing for executives, entrepreneurs, and consultants, my goal is simple: getting you hired to your target job in the shortest time.

I achieve that for you in two ways:

1️⃣ First, by writing and tailoring your resume, cover letter, and/or LinkedIn to the latest HR and recruiter hiring preferences in your industry.

2️⃣ Second, by creating one-of-a-kind, eye-catching personal branding that increases your perceived value to companies and accelerates your job search.

I dive deep into identifying your career goals and create an optimized, custom-tailored strategy that best ensures you achieve your career goals as quickly as possible.

As you can see from my testimonials, I don’t provide a normal resume, cover letter, or LinkedIn - I deliver the best of the best, period, and take no shortcuts in getting there.

I help my clients:

✅ Secure six-figure and executive positions by crafting HR- and recruiter-optimized resumes using hiring psychology to establish you as the best-fit job candidate on paper.

✅ Receive “secret” invites to interviews on LinkedIn by creating personally branded, optimized profiles that evoke authority, thought leadership, and attract recruiters.

✅ Land interviews to targeted online job postings by creating custom-tailored cover letters that check off every box a company is looking for in an ideal candidate.

Past clients include: Executives, Sales Managers, Senior Directors, Engineers, and more.

It's a challenge finding a career expert and resume writer with all-world results - someone who knows how to get you hired fast and has the proven track record to meet your goals.

You won’t find the lowest rate by hiring me, but you will find someone who delivers back 100 times on your career investment the first time, on time.

If you’re ready to drastically accelerate your job search and get hired, click the button at the top-right side of this page to invite me to your job or hire me directly.
