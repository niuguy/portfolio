Asking around we've heard Apache Spark may somehow help with that. There's also Cloud Dataflow which looks promising. But you should explain and know what could be better or why we should use these specific tools."

6.) I need the bot to remove orders from the Input.xlsx file when they have been fulfilled. If they fail they are to stay in the Input.xlsx file.

7.) The CMD should show me a status of the orders. When it runs it should say how many total ebay orders there are (example: ""100 eBay orders to complete""). Then when it starts it should give me a progress after each order, (example: ""20 ebay orders completed, 10 ebay orders failed, 70 ebay orders remaining).

Mathematically i would like to know, if for example women represent a certain proportion of the applicants, and they have say 25% less chance of receiving a call back from employers, how would the proportion of female candidates reduce (if at all) if a new application process is required at each stage of career progression (lets say5 stages)

I can’t seem to figure out confidently what the implications would be, and need someone who is well versed in mathematics with an understanding of probability to make this clear to me.

It will also help if there are any analogous scenarios that exist e.g. dominant recessive genes, surname extinction theory.

They have over 10,000 images of dog/cat eyes and the associated diagnoses. They would like to see if they could train a model to make future diagnoses of eye issues. 

There are a few potentially complicating factors. 
1) The photos of the eyes have varying levels of quality (brightness, flash, angle, distance)
2) An eye can have one or more diagnosis (which means that this is likely a multi-label classification problem) and these issues are usually dependent on each other

I have a decent amount of knowledge about ML, but I need help implementing the model and then optimizing the parameters to improve accuracy. 

Here are a few questions I'd like you to answer so that I can better understand how you work.

Machine Learning Math - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) in Excel,$25 ,[],"I’m looking for someone to teach me how SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) works using a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets) without using any code/VBA/Excel add-ins/etc.  Why?  Quite simply, I love learning machine learning techniques and I cannot understand the math behind SVD and need help!

If you’re up for the challenge, I imagine this will only take a couple hours and will likely be a good refresher for you.  I need this to be completed by end of day Tuesday, August 14th.

The spreadsheet you build will take any 3x4 matrix of numbers (A = 3 rows, 4 columns) and show 3 output matrices (A = UxSxV*, V = Transformed V, S = Singular Values)

SPREADSHEET OVERVIEW:

A. INPUTS (A 3x4 matrix)

A = Input Matrix (Any numerical values, can be integers, can have decimals, can be positive or negative values, value examples: -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, etc.)

B. OUTPUTS (3 = U, S, V)
3 separate matrices (U, S, and V) where S = the singular values.

- The 3 matrices should be clearly labeled in the spreadsheet.
- Each matrix should be the result of formulas that I can follow as I want to see each step of the math
- No VBA, no Excel add-in, no use of “Goal Seek/Solver”
- The result of the 3 separate matrices (U x S x VT) should equal A (original input matrix)

C. SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- The 3 output matrices update automatically when I adjust any value in the input matrix
- Each step of the math can be followed in the spreadsheet.  No code.
- Solution is correct

D. CHECKS:  I will check for “correctness” using the following tools.  I should be able to plug in any set of 3x4 inputs into the spreadsheet and the 3 output matrices should match the result from these 2 tools.  Please note: rounding/decimal differences are ok.

1. http://people.revoledu.com/kardi/tutorial/LinearAlgebra/SVD.html (scroll down and type input numbers, then click “Singular Value Decomposition”)

2. http://www.bluebit.gr/matrix-calculator/ (type numbers and select “Singular Value Decomposition” and then “Calculate”)

E. HELPFUL RESOURCES:

Entity or Relationship Visualization capability / tool please,30+ hrs/week,[],"Hi

Please help. I am relisting this job which has gone off track twice previously.

Visualization is rapidly changing and newer tools/functionally now available. We do wonder about D3 Javascript if this could do what is required.

Why this has happened ? What seems to have happened is that the Freelancers thought we would pass them the spreadsheet and they would have time to manually build the chart. This is wrong.

What would happen is the user on our website would choose to visualize a report (various report types) we would then pass your program that relevant data in a structured excel spreadsheet format and your solution would visualize the detail immediately. (may take a few seconds to populate) 

The original post and what we described is as below.
Show Related Entity in Visualization Capability

Background;
We provide data resources to our clients in support of a myriad of business processes. 
This data is in the form of Company Reports, Motor Vehicle Ownership reports, Property Ownership Reports etc. Naturally the detail or nodes in the reports changes. (nodes being the people, addresses, motor vehicle, companies etc)

We are looking to provide a data visualization capability to provide simple visualization capability. A picture paints one thousand words !!

Environment
• We provide web based access (IE8+, Chrome etc) to the portal
• We require a solution compatible with .NET
• Many of our clients do not support Java so HTML5 support is preferred
• We are looking for a locally hosted solution to maintain control of data and integrity of sovereignty
• We have no preference for the tool selected by you to visualize the data provided

Requirement
• Where a customer selects to visualize the data we will pass your solution the relevant structured spreadsheet excel or csv which will contain the detail of the relevant nodes and relationships and in the given entity. Being a company, property or similar report. Sample of the spreadsheets we will pass are attached. We will write these data extract files.  
• We will then call the provided tool and pass it the table (your job)
• The tool must present then display the data in a graphic format/network chart to display the entities and relationships between them. Picture format. Samples of the visualizations we are looking for are again attached.
• The resulting graphic should be able to be directly saved by the user as either a picture or .pdf  It would be an advantage if the user can edit the visualization chart
• Preference will be given to solutions that allow interactive filtering (eg on time or length from a specific node)
• Preference will also be given to solutions which allow a selection of formats
• There may also be future requirements to access relevant social media sites (external) and incorporate findings in diagrams
• Ongoing cost of ownership will be a criterion in selection

Samples of the charts (data) we will provide and the type of visualizations showing the connections we would like your product/solution to then display are attached."

Report about the city of Vancouver,10-30 hrs/week,[],"Basic outline for the report

Housing demand was created because Vancouver such a wonderful livable city.  
You can Ski
Go to the beach
Wonderful hotel, restaurants, parks , 
Lots of green space

Government didn’t respond properly at either level
1.	Municipal
2.	Provincial
Housing was treated like the tobacco industry. Government needed more money so they increase housing taxes
CAC’s – Community Amenity Contributions increased
Taxes were placed on Foreigners

Everyone blamed the developers

Greed is common place both in government and with developers

How do you solve it? You increase supply
This is very difficult to do in Vancouver because of all the building codes permits and focus on green and the environment

We went too far green because we did not ask the question what does our (Vancouver) environment need.
Environmental needs change from municipality to city , to province to country.

We need to stop adding cost that have no value for Vancouver.

What the policy makers do not understand is that they have to be accountable to the dollar. What is being paid, vs what is being brought in vs the value gained

Who can make the decision 
1.	The person who wins or loses the dollar

Example: When we built the Olympic village there were sun controlled sensors for the blinds – Why the extra cost for what Vancouver is overcast 70% of the time
Collecting rainwater – why  


Government needs to state what it is exactly that they want in housing. This is very difficult to do 
Then 
Get the private sector involved to 
Find a better cheaper way to do it 
Examples are social housing
“ does the government even release their actual spending on social housing”

Government are inept in making decisions because 
1.	They have no experience 
2.	Cannot be held accountable for their decisions because ultimately its not their actual money

We as a city /province/country are a very rich. When people want something they complain and the social safety net expands

If you had a free ticket to get groceries we would have no grocery in the store. We can’t let this thought invade"

Accident reconstruction,$150 ,"[{""skill"":""Mathematics""}]","I am looking for someone or a company with expertise in accicedent reconstruction. I need either someone with physics expertise (PhD) or access to software like EDCRASH or Virtualcrash4. I want to determine the speed of the police car
     
Additional details: I am defending a traffic ticket of $165 where my daughter was hit by a police car and charged with failure to yield to an emergency vehicland. Her car was totaled with damage to a police car (one of 7-8 responding to a crime) and damage to a home that her car struck.  She was in a residential neighborhood on a two lane road in a double yellow no passing zone. She was at a dead stop waiting to make a left turn and while doing so was hit. She was propelled approximately 75 feet over a curb, across the front yard, scraped two trees on each side of the car and ended up a foot and a half through a cbs block wall of the home. The stated speed limit is 20 mph. Police policy is to not exceed 25 mph over. The police reports that the officer believes he was going 40-45. We are certain that the speed is much greater and need support for traffic court. Unrelated to the scope of this engagement is that the report claims it was dark but we have pictures showing it is light and the police claim they had sirens, complying with policy but we have five witnesses who state they did not

We have police drawing of the accident and pictures. She was hit early in her turn from a complete stop so we estimate her speed at 5 mph. The car travelled 70-90 feet, we think 75. We wish to use physics formula or preferably crash reconstructure software from someone experienced in this area.  This is my first experience with outsourcing

Our plan is to use a stablecoin to represent the dollar and have it sent to various countries with cash-out points being provided by third-party cryptocurrency exchanges.

We are looking for someone with an understanding of the fintech industry to help us in creating the entry point from the US dollar to cryptocurrency. We want to ultimately have a transmitter's license so that we can natively swap USD for a crypto representative stablecoin. We understand that will take time and effort, so our contingency plan until that point is to rely on a bank sponsor to provide this service for us until we can do it ourselves.

We are looking for someone who can help with the following research:

1) What is the practicality, as well as the the cost and requirements, for having a bank sponsor that can provide the service of taking funds from our customers and letting us to give them crypto in exchange?

2) What do we need in order for us to apply for transmitters licenses in the US so that we can provide this service ourselves? What are the costs, and how long would the process take?

3) We also need someone to research remittance competitors, their fees, and how well we can stack our fees in comparison (given the information we can provide on our estimated fees along with what is researched in terms of above-mentioned costs).   

We are looking for someone with the fintech and remittance-industry experience to guide us to have a clear understanding of the process. We are willing to either hire for a one-time research, or if helpful enough, to onboard as an advisor or team member that can receive a long-term contract with our company.

Data analysis for content marketing,10-30 hrs/week,[],"Zocdoc is looking to leverage our data about patient booking behaviors to create compelling stories and content. Our hope is to find interesting and/or surprising trends.

For this particular request, we're interested in analyzing data on booking behaviors about if patients book appointments of their own gender and how that varies by specialty, age, location and booking time to appointment.

The data to be analyzed is 1 year of booking data with the following data points:
- Visit reason
- State
- Metropolitan area
- Patient age range
- Patient gender
- Provider gender
- Provider specialty
- Date appointment was booked
- Date of appointment

For context, below are some articles we've done in the past that analyze our data and should give you an idea of the outcome we're trying to get:
https://thescript.zocdoc.com/what-times-of-year-are-doctors-the-most-and-least-busy/
https://thescript.zocdoc.com/what-are-the-most-useful-languages-for-doctors/

The output of this assignment should be a chart (can be made in PPT or excel) with a summary statement to answer each of the following questions:

1. Do patients tend to book appointments with providers of their own gender? If so, how does that vary between male and female patients? (ie: women are more likely to book appointments with female providers?)

2. Are patients more likely to book certain types of appointments with same-gender providers  more than others? (ie: are women more likely to book a pap smear with a female obgyn?)

3. Are patients more likely to book appointments with same-gender providers for certain specialties more than others? (ie: are women more likely to book with a female obgyn?)

4. Are patients of a certain age ranges more likely to book appointments with same-gender providers? (ie: younger patients are less likely to book an appointment with same-gender provider)

5. Are patients in certain geographical locations more likely to book appointments with same-gender providers? (ie: patients in the south are more likely to book an appointment with same-gender providers)

6. Does the time of booking-to-appointment impact gender of doctor selection? (ie: Even though we found women tend to book appointments with female providers, this is not true for last-minute appointments -- those booked within 24 or 48 hours of the appointment).

If during your analysis you find another interesting trend or data point, please include that as well!

Classification Library:
My application will handle spinning the ball, and take a photo every 20 degrees of rotation.

If not, I will spin the ball some more and take a new photo.

All images will be taken with the ball in a fixed position in relation to the camera. The images should be consistent.

BACKGROUND

We are working on a technology platform related to the financial planning industry. This platform primarily aims to provide a rating service for the individual/institutional financial planners. In addition, it will enable listing of financial products by the individual/institutional financial planners and will provide robo-advisory services for the consumers integrating AI. 

We have filed a patent application for the Rating Model, which will be provided to the shortlisted candidates.
 
We now want to decide on the specifics of the technical implementation of this Rating Model along with the other features on a web and a mobile interface.

OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT: WHAT WE WANT THE FREELANCER TO DELIVER?
 
1). Decide on the technical/technological stack in detail. i.e. decide the frameworks, languages, database, and software products required for the implementation (including the requirements on AI integration and also we need to explore the feasibility on a blockchain based implementation)

2). Create the preliminary software architecture/designs in the form of flow charts (These will be included in our business plan).

3). The Rating takes into account two (2) sets of institutions viz.

•	For whom only the public data is available, and 
•	From whom the data will be solicited. 

From the linked Template of the listing of probable questions for the Rating Model as indicated, please let us know what information could be derived from the public domain and what information could be sought only via sourcing directly from the Financial Advisor?

4). Please recommend the details for the development of software and IT Platform as mentioned along with the details of the Technology proposed.

5). Essentially we seek a comprehensive Consultancy on IT Architecture Design for the said Project 

Based on the software being proposed, we want to initiate establishing the validity of the Rating Model by virtue of creating a prototype (already done) and testing the Proof of Concept (POC) for Rating of Financial Advisors based on the data available in the public domain.

Furthermore, initially we look forward to use the said software to test the Prototype of the Rating Model, incorporating the sensitivity analysis and essentially testing the Proof of Concept: And subsequently, use the said Prototype to evaluate the Financial Advisors' Rating based on the solicitation basis as well. 

The Application of following Technology may be explored to be used:

•Cloud Technology with AI, ML, NLP and Hadoop for Big Data Analytics for Automated Risk Profiling, Financial Planning and Financial advisory.

•Integration of various other Open APIs, Chat bots for secured faster due diligence, advisory, online payment for all stakeholders of ecosystem.

•Exploring Block chain coding for secured contracting & payment on the platform.

TECHNOLOGICAL FEATURES TO BE EVALUATED

1). The technology should be focusing on the Business Analytics that is based on the use of structured data to achieve competitive advantage. Structured data analytics may include primarily three categories of data model: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.

2). These three categories should support the customer of the platform. Further these data model need to work on supervised and unsupervised data learning for better data learning and model and this may be done by machine algorithms and other data mining process.

3). It is proposed that we use the Cloud Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Leaning, Artificial Neural Network, Blockchain Technology and Hadoop programming for big data analytics for structure and unstructured data mining and prediction in view of long term strategic vision of the company.

BACKGROUND ON RATING MODEL

The misalignment of distribution incentives with the goals of the investors have left financial consumers floundering. The evolution of the collective business interests of all stakeholders warrants keeping the citizen’s interest in the centrum. Accordingly, a  Business Model based on scientific principles has been established which would be  the key to developing the value proposition amongst the advisers, distributors etc. so  that the financial consumer shall be able to choose the most eligible distributor on the  basis of select parameters to achieve their financial goals. The same has being duly  recognized by the regulators as well. 

The following parameters are applied for evolving the Rating:

 Approach to Financial Planning Process 
 Policy on Investors’ interest 
 Organization structure and Corporate Governance 
 History/Background 
 Risk management Policy and System 
 Firms Positioning and Offerings 
 Management Policy on Compliance and disclosures 
 Organization’s Processes and Procedures 
 Financials 
 Resources and Infrastructure

Is there any way we can fit in AI, without breaking the bank?

Machine learning - Prediction - Regression,Less than 10 hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""Data Science""},{""skill"":""Machine Learning""}]","Who are we ?
An influencer marketing company launched in 2016.

What do we do?
We connect brands with Youtubers. Say you want to promote your product, we are going to find the right person to promote it (targeted audience, fame, actual influence...). 
Then, we are providing them with the brand guidelines and a tracking link to be able to measure their conversion. 
Finally we provide analytics to our clients (brands) on how much sales/installs they generated thanks to the number of clicks we measured. They can measure their ROI and we can measure how good an influencer was at selling a product. 

Example? 
Of course, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW8PF0hTWvA

What we want from you?
Since our first marketing campaigns, we learnt a lot on how selecting the influencers to get the best ROI. For example, it is better to select 10 influencers with 1M followers intead of 1 big influencer with 10M followers.
We want to automate the influencer selection process by analyzing past social media posts of an influencer and be able to measure his/her real influence.
The idea is to be able to predict the conversion rate, the ratio viewers to clickers. 

What we have done?
We had an intern who started a first draft but the results were not very accurate, probably because we did not gather enough data. 
We were thinking doing a machine learning regression model that will be trained by taking the biggest amount of data points related to a post as inputs, and the conversion viewers to clickers as the output.
Example of data points: number of likes, number of comments, average length of the comments.
A repo is already set up with some Python code to gather these data points.

About the job?
You will talk directly to the CTO, he will reply to all the technical and business related questions. 
You are not required to deploy the project but a good documentation is essential. 
We will be able to deliver quickly any API endpoint to gather Youtube data if needed."

The cameras I used (Theta/Xiaomi) do provide metadata about the orientation from their gyroscope and I already work with that. However based on my learnings the precision if often below 2 degrees, which is not good enough for my app. This needs to be corrected by the user in a visual & manual manner, which takes a lot of time and some practice and 3D thinking - so it needs to be optimised in my opinion.

I found several implementation and scientific papers from the last few years that deal with the topic and had very promising results. I even found matlab implementations. However I lack skills in matlab and computer vision but really need this microservice that my Node.js backend could send the images to and get back either a corrected image or the calculated pitch/roll/yaw of the image. I'd imagine a python or c++ microservice I could bundle into Docker instance to get the work done.

If you're interested in this topic and in the job I'll gladly send the papers via pm - I don't want to upload scientific paper of other people here for the open public.

Looking forward to work with you,
best,
Milan

p.s. as I'm an Angular & Node Pro and experienced Software Architect but do not have experienced in this field ... and I invest into this entirely on my own it's hard to see what price would be adequate - please consider correcting my price idea if I'm running in the wrong direction ;)"

We are working with a workforce agency to implement a randomized control trial to evaluate strategies to increase reemployment speed and match quality of job seekers. As a part of a broader intervention to evaluate strategies to increase reemployment speed and match quality of job seekers, we will provide under- and unemployed workers with personalized job matches based on their work experience and successful job search trajectories of similar workers from prior cohorts. One of the core activities of our project is developing an algorithm to generate these personalized job matches. We have data on workforce histories and preferences for roughly 3 million job seekers. Our hope is to use machine learning tools to generate recommended job openings for individuals.. We are looking for someone to advise us on the applicability of existing tools to our task as well as potentially build new tools (or customize existing tools) to our application. See attachment for an overview of the project.   We are breaking the overall project into three overall sub-tasks:

(1) (Short-term with quick turnaround requested) - Development of a job scraping tool to scrape and standardize job openings from indeed dot com (or perhaps another public job posting site if  the contractor has prior experience with a different platform).  For example:  https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=data%20analyst&l=Charlottesville%2C%20VA&radius=50&jt=fulltime&explvl=senior_level&vjk=bc4eb95b049f23e3.    At minimum, we want the job title, location, posting date, salary range (if available), and the full description texts (in HTML format) to be saved into different columns of a table.  We would like to be able to run this tool ourselves providing an Excel or similar table of inputs to be searched and returning an Excel or similar table of outputs.  We are using Python for other components of the project so prefer that language all else equal.

(2) (Medium-term) - If possible and the contractor has prior experience, we'd also like additional standardized information extracted from the descriptions (please make suggestions on how this might be accomplished).  The goal here is to extract components that can be matched to the information we have on job seekers, which includes basic demographics, prior jobs held (standardized into ONET codes) and durations, experience in different industries, current job sought, keywords, education, training and certifications, etc.).

(3) (Medium- to long-term) Assistant with development of code to match job seekers with job openings.  Currently we are pursuing a two-part strategy.  Part 1: Recommend occupation types based on observed transitions of individuals between occupations (collaborative filtering).  Part 2: Recommend specific occupations based on a matching of job seeker and job opening characteristics.  We would like someone with experience to consult on our approach and potentially assist with developing code (again, ideally Python) to improve our matches."

GOOGLE

- Get a list of every town and city in each of the countries
- Search facebook/google for ""hostel"" + [city]
- Go through the results and check which hostels do not have a website listed
- Store contact details and facebook page/google listing for hostels without website

Is citation count correlated with google trends?
Does research popularity precede google trends?

Are there any outliers?
Are there any genomic regions that have no information?

VBA Excel Program for Capital Budgeting,$30 ,"[{""skill"":""Data Analytics""},{""skill"":""Data Entry""},{""skill"":""Excel VBA""},{""skill"":""Financial Analysis""},{""skill"":""Microsoft Excel""}]","Looking to have a VBA program created utilizing the following information:

1.  Generate 25 projects with uniformly distributed first costs ranging from 40,000 to 280,000; uniformly distributed lives from 2 – 10 years; and uniformly distributed rates of return  (IRR) from 5 – 40%.  With this information the yearly cash flow (which is the same each year) can be computed.  The yearly cash flow can be computed by multiplying the first cost by:  ((1+i)^n)i/((1+i^n)-1).  This same process will then be used to generate 24 additional projects with varying first costs, lives, and yearly cash flows.

2.  Compute the payback for each project and rank the projects generated in step one using payback, which is the length of time need to return the initial cost.  This is equal to the first cost divided by the annual cash flow.  The smaller the better.

3.  From the ranked list, use an initial capital budget of $600,000 to buy as many projects as possible.  Only whole projects can be purchased.  Any unused cash will rollover to year two.  Keep track of the projects purchased and continue to year two.  For year two generate 30 projects, rank them, and purchase projects using the money that projects purchased in year one have provided through their yearly cash flows.  Note that any project purchased will return the yearly cash flow every year through its life.  For year three generate 35 projects, rank them and purchase using the same approach.  Continue this process in year four with 40 projects and year five with 45 projects.  

4. For the five year period several projects will have been purchased during each of the five years.  Some of these projects with short lives are no longer returning any cash, and some of the projects with longer lives will still be returning cash.  To compare the capital budgeting ranking methods we want to see how much wealth has been accumulated by the company during this period.  The measure we will use will be to at the end of year five add up the money the projects will still return from the end of year five to the end of the projects’ lives to get one value of the net wealth at the end of year five.  For example a project bought in year 3 with a 7 year life will have 5 years of cash flows left.  If each yearly cash flow is say 45,000, the value of the remaining life of this project would be 5 * 45,000 = 225,000.  This process would need to be repeated for all projects that have cash flows remaining starting at the end of year five.  This value will be used as the net wealth.  This completes one cycle of the simulation for one ranking method.  This will need to be completed for 30 cycles for this ranking method.  Compute the average and standard deviation for the 30 cycles.

5. Complete this process (steps 1-4) for two additional ranking methods:   Net present value (NPV) using i = 15% and  Internal rate of return (IRR). The IRR has already been computed for each project.  Complete 30 cycles for each of these methods."

We are building our product as an online system independent of third party providers.

We are looking for someone who is happy to work remotely, who loves large amounts of data and finding meaning within it.

You have a great understanding of how to visualise the data showing trends anomalies and potential actions for our customers. This is not a role that we have had previously and we are looking for someone to help and guide us.

Our data is primarily pricing information from eCommerce companies - we monitor our client competitors' retail sites for price fluctuation as well as new products, removed products, items out of stock, promotional activities, product reviews etc.

Currently we create a number of reports based on this information. These include; 

- Daily price changes on selective data
- Promotional changes. For example, a product has had the “Buy 2, get 1 free” promotion removed
- New product reviews that have been given a low star rating

We are looking at ‘what’s next’ and would love to work with someone proactive who can help us to improve our reporting systems as well as to work on our clients data to spot ongoing opportunities.

In order to move this forward, we would be looking initially at paid consultancy, providing access to some of our data and seeing what insights you can glean as well as advice from you on what kind of reporting and technologies you would suggest. For the right people we are looking to build a long-term relationship.

If you are interested in the role and becoming part of our distributed team please tell us the following:
•	How many hours you have available and what hours you. prefer to work, including your timezone
•	What skills you have that you think can be of use to us
•	What you have done previously to help businesses to make decisions or to find insight from their data
•	Where you are from. Geography doesn’t matter to us, but it’s always nice to find out where people live and work!
•	Anything else about you and what you have done previously that might make us choose you over someone else

Once we have talked with a everyone and shortlisted we will provide some paid work to assess how we work together.

Discriminating neural network script created in Python.,$20 ,"[{""skill"":""Artificial Neural Networks""},{""skill"":""Deep Learning""},{""skill"":""Machine Learning""},{""skill"":""Python""}]","SUMMARY
Use Python scripting language to create 2 scripts for training and recall of a neural network that is trained to perform a discriminating function.
Script #1 - Trains a discriminating neural network, which we will call 'D', to recognize a pattern.
Script #2 - Recall mode for using the trained D neural network to evaluate inputs to ascertain if they contain or do not contain the pattern D was trained to recognize.

Scripts to performing training and recall of a discriminating neural network are published in various places on the web, so you may be able to assemble most of the code by using existing code.

INPUT FILE FORMAT
Input file is ASCII format
Contains one or more rows.
Data in each row consists of real numbers scaled between -1 to +1.
Each number in a row is separated by a comma.
Each row ends with line a feed character (ASCII 10).

TRAINING FILE
Training file will contain several rows.  Each row contains an example of the pattern the D network is being trained to recognize.  Number of inputs may be several thousand.  For example, an input file might contain 6,000 inputs, or it might contain 60,000 inputs.  The number of inputs will be specified in a command line parameter passed to the training script.

RECALL FILE
Recall file will contain one or more rows.  The data in each row may or may not contain an example of the pattern. 

SCRIPT #1
This script trains the D network.
Command line parameters will be passed to the script when it is invoked from the command line.  
The parameters indicate the following:
1. Name, including path, of input training file. 
2. Number of columns (or fields) in each row.
3. Name, including path, of the solution file that will be saved when the D network is trained.  The solution file will contain all necessary information (such as layers and weights, et cetera) pertaining to the optimal solution.
4. Maximum amount of time allowed during training.  Training will cease if this time is reached or exceeded.  Training may cease earlier if a perfect solution is found.
5. A parameter to indicate if training progress is displayed, or kept silent.
7. A parameter indicating the name of a file, including path, to which summary statistics about the training session are the be written.  The most important statistic is a number that shows the accuracy of the trained network.  Any other information written to that file would be helpful, but not absolutely necessary.

Your script should either attempt to select the optimal number of hidden layers and nodes in each layer based on the number of inputs, or, alternatively, you may provide additional input parameters so these features could be controlled by the user.  If you provide additional input parameters, please provide some explanation on how to use those parameters.

SCRIPT #2
Use the trained D network to output a number, between 0 to 1, that indicates the probability the input row contains a pattern the discriminating network was trained to recognize.
If the row contains something random, or something that has absolutely no resemblance to a pattern the D network was trained to recognize, it should output a 0.
If the row contains a pattern the D network was trained to recognize, it should output a 1.
If the row contains a pattern that is similar, but not identical to what D was trained to recognize, the output should be some value less than 1.
Command line parameters will be passed to the script when it is invoked from the command line.
The parameters indicate the following:
1. Name, including path, of input file.  If full path is not specified, assume file is in current directory folder.
2. Name, including path, of the solution file that was saved when the D network was trained.
3. Name, including path, of the output file.  Each row of the output file will contain a real number scaled between 0 and 1 that indicates the probability the data in the row represents the pattern D was trained to recognize."

Data mining strategy for my marketplace,$500 ,[],"Putting a dummy quote as I'm not sure of the cost

We are working on building a marketplace for Caterers and Venue locations for events (think Birthdays, Baby showers, Team lunches, Office parties, etc). To start with, we are going to launch in Melbourne Australia. I'm looking for someone to help me with good data mining strategy and also implement it. 

Below are the forms which have the details I would like to capture.
https://form.jotform.co/81822645684869
https://form.jotform.co/81822912984869

Most likely we should scrape some of the data and do cold calling to fill in the data from each of the caterers and venue locations.

Here are the sources that we can start from:
1. Gumtree
2. Orderin.com.au
3. https://venuemob.com.au/
4. Yelp
5. zomato
6. Meetup 

Our idea is to get most of the info from existing sources, and do cold calling to capture rest of the data. We may need a sign-off from them as well that they are ok to register with us. 

I need more help on the later part, where we need to make calls to caterers/venue places and get them registered with us.

Pls share any similar work you have done before. Provide me rough timelines in terms of how long you think it might take. Also provide me a quote. The website may take 1-2 months for the development to be complete. 

This is for Melbourne, Australia Only.

Scaling Tensorflow image classifier on AWS,10-30 hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""Amazon EC2""},{""skill"":""Flask""},{""skill"":""Load Balancing""},{""skill"":""Nginx""},{""skill"":""Python""}]","The end goal:  Have users see images from their social media run through a tensforflow classifier and scored in real-time.

The concern: Users have several hundred images each, and we expect many concurrent users, and we are worried that our classifier service will not be able to handle the traffic.

Currently, the classifier is a Flask application served via Gunicorn behind a Nginx proxy running on EC2 instances, which are behind an AWS Application load balancer.

Logging the app while running, we are taking about 0.12 seconds to fetch and resize the images, and another 0.16 seconds to classify it. In total, this means a total request is taking about 0.3s from end to end.  Given that request time, each worker can handle about 3 requests per second without any issue. Using the recommended #CPU * 2 + 1 = workers we get:  on a 1 CPU instance, we can do ~9 requests a second, a 2 CPU machine, ~15 requests, etc.

Our client is queueing requests and only allowing 3 simultaneous classifications per user, which roughly translates to one user = one worker process. So if we were to have 20 concurrent users, we'd need 20 worker processes, which would require  5 instances running 2 CPUs each (or one 10 CPU instance....) When I load test our service, I do see that once we sustain more than 3 requests per second per worker for more than a few seconds, we start to get 502 errors, so that seems to bear out my assumptions.

What I am wondering is if we can speed up the resizing or classification time so we can reduce our potential server load and improve our user experience.  I know effectively nothing about tensorflow, so I am hoping someone who does can see if there are places we can improve our time per request."

You must offer some measure of what you're going to charge me here. There are far too many applicants for this gig for me to discuss your fee over the phone.

Preamble.....
Ignore the number in the budget field. UW requires a # in that field. 

This is fixed priced project based work, not hourly.  If you're interested in this gig, we'll discuss each individual project and you'll offer a fixed price bid for each individual project.

The Work.....
I have raw quantitative data that needs to be striped of meaningless data and characters, and turned into meaningful data to help me more deeply understand my business margins and costs.

Following your high quality work, the next most important item is that your work must be understandable by me, a non quant. You must know how create and present to me in Excel understandable work such that I can easily represent your data to other parties without your assistance.

You must be a super competent Excel jock, deliver results per my timeline, and come with the requisite skill sets to know how to clean data and turn it into meaningful data with reasonable speed and efficiency.

Let me know. Thanks.  Craig"

1. What products are most frequently purchased (and not returned) together? Can we predict how likely a customer is that likes product A, will also like Product B? 
2. Are there any insights into what products people tend to purchase successfully the first time? Are there certain products or baskets that are more or less likely to be successful (not returned) and turn the customer into a repeat buyer? 

Sizing / Fit Recommendations (3rd priority):

I would need the digitization to be precise enough that the borders of the Belgian Congo match with the contemporaneous borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

3) Very precisely digitize (i.e. create a shapefile of points) each mission station (that is what the historical maps are about). In both maps each location is represented by a point and a name. Mission stations have their name underline in black in maps Streit_1929_RDC1-4 and in red in maps Dennis_1911_RDC1-2. It is for those locations that I would need a shapefile.

Develop a production ready object detection model for small objects (vehicles and people) and fires,"$1,500 ","[{""skill"":""Artificial Intelligence""},{""skill"":""Artificial Neural Networks""},{""skill"":""Computer Vision""},{""skill"":""Data Analytics""},{""skill"":""Data Science""}]","We have a camera (30x optical zoom; thermal with no zoom; can select optical or thermal individually, not at the same time [although picture-in-picture mode is available]; 360 degree rotation) attached to a balloon, drone, or tower. Given a video feed of the area, detect the location of people, cars, and fires. Pan, tilt, zoom, and the ability to switch between optical and thermal cameras can all be programmed as desired. Fires should probably be treated separately than people and cars. Fires are notoriously difficult for object detection. Equally, the cars and people will be viewed from a distance, making them small objects in the video feed. Small object detection is also notoriously difficult. I’ve found a few academic papers which may help. This paper (https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/982780/1/Yuan_PhD_F2017.pdf) describes the difficulty of fire detection and various methods to go about it. One of the problems is that there is hard to get a decent size dataset of forest fires. This paper (https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877705817362574/1-s2.0-S1877705817362574-main.pdf?_tid=27c401a2-689e-437f-b714-e9d7cf007721&acdnat=1532100457_5baa009ee3293766244e9c490054c060) used an interesting approach of simulating a fire in Blender and overlaying that simulated fire on a variety of background images to come up with a large dataset.

The small object detection is a different kind of difficult problem. This is due to small objects having few features for the model to train on. This paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05274) summarizes an approach using Generative Adversarial Networks for better performance on small object detection. It achieves state of the art accuracy. I tried to find the code online and it doesn’t look like it was published. I haven’t contacted the author for the code yet. This is another interesting paper (http://www.nae-lab.org/~rei/publication/takeki-icip2016.pdf) about a method that was used to detect birds.

This is a video of Sentient Vision’s VIDAR (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C2RyiRgGTw). This is the level of small object detection we would like to get to and that is demonstrated to be possible.

I haven’t tried any object detection with the thermal camera yet, but we would like to have the functionality to detect cars, people, and fires at night as well, albeit with less range due to thermal not having zoom.

Fair warning, I tried using NVIDIA’s DetectNet with a relatively small self-made dataset (10,000 images total) and had a zero mAP for fires and people and almost 0.20 mAP for cars. I can share the model, results, and dataset with you, if desired. You are free to use any dataset you can find, but keep in mind the video feed will be from high in the air, from 90 degrees (looking straight down) to approximately 30 degrees. You are also free to augment the detection with the thermal images, but keep in mind the thermal camera doesn’t have zoom, so the range will be far less. 

Note: This will be running on an NVIDIA TX2, so hardware acceleration using NVIDIA’s libraries should be utilized as much as possible.

Deliverable: Take a video feed from an RTSP stream and run it through a model to detect fires, people, and cars with a reasonable accuracy compared to modern methods and running at real-time speeds. Output the confidence level of the detection and the bounding box location."

3. Generating a list of commonly occurring words in the dataset, removing the most common words in German, and then generating a mini repression dictionary in German based on repression words used in the biographical entries.

* Contact name - Person's name
* Business name - if unknown, enter the web URL

Your specific scraping methods will be up to you, as long as you are able to gather valid data that matches the specification.

Article Recommendation Engine via ML / Google Cloud Platform / Tensorflow,30+ hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""English""},{""skill"":""Google Cloud Platform""},{""skill"":""Machine Learning""},{""skill"":""Python""},{""skill"":""TensorFlow""}]","There is an existing tutorial describing how to implement an article recommendation system using Google Analytics 360 data (BigQuery) and the Google Cloud Platform. We want to have that system implemented for our environment:

We want to use machine learning to recommend articles to our blog users. 

The article recommendation system is based on the idea that users who read similar articles share preferences. Therefore we intend to use the collaborative filtering technique for generating user recommendations. The collaborative filtering problem can be solved using matrix factorization. For this purpose you can use the weighted alternating least squares method.

We want to recommend articles based on user behaviour being tracked in Google Analytics 360. The data can be provided in BigQuery.

If articles are appealing to users this is likely to have a positive impact on the click through rate. The same applies for the time spent on page for recommended articles. The main objective is to increase the DoubleClick for Publishers revenue.

As soon as a user enters the website, we want to be able to request data from BigQuery to make article recommendations.

Here follows a description of the tasks:

Overview

Part 1: Create the model
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/recommendation-system-tensorflow-create-model
Use the WALS algorithm in TensorFlow to make predictions for the article data set.

Part 2: Train and Tune on Cloud ML Engine
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/recommendation-system-tensorflow-train-cloud-ml-engine
Use the Cloud Machine Learning Engine to train the model and employ its hyperparameter tuning feature to optimize the model.

Part 3: Apply to Data from Google Analytics
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/recommendation-system-tensorflow-apply-to-analytics-data
Apply the recommendation system to data imported directly from Google Analytics 360 in order to perform recommendations for websites that use Analytics.

Part 4: Deploy the Recommendation System
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/recommendation-system-tensorflow-deploy
Deploy the production system on Google Cloud Platform to make real recommendations for the website.

Kindly note that everything has to be documented and the code has to be commented.

Deliverables:
1) System installed on our cloud environment
2) Snippet to integrate in the website
3) Documentation how to deploy the system for other sites in terms of how to conceptualize (with pointers to the google documents)
4) Documentation for customization and optimization possibilities (i.e. how to determine new dimensions and metrics)

Gantt chart creation,$100 ,[],"Hello, 

We make machines (m/c) and we want to make gantt charts for each of the machines on the floor. Each m/c takes anywhere between 20 to 75 days to be assembled and tested.

Basically each machine consists of 400 to 700 parts and these are parts of different sub-assemblies, which are eventually fitted on the machine. There could be 12 to 20 sub-assemblies in each machine and each sub-assembly can have about 30 to 70 parts.
Each sub-assembly has to be fitted on the machine. Some sub-assemblies have to be assembled on the machine itself whereas others can be assembled offline. That is, the sub-assembly when assembled can be directly fitted on the machine.  
Some sub-assemblies are dependent on others and therefore sequence has to be followed whereas some can be fitted alongside others (non-dependent).
In layman terms, each sub-assembly can be treated as a task. And the if there is a need to break down, the task to a child task, that should be possible.

I am using a free version of a software from ganttexcel.com, which can be used in excel itself. I will need to buy their paid version, once I am sure this software can help me.  I don't want to spend a lot on those high-cost software.

What I want from ganttexcel is explained below. But if someone proposes another simple software, which can help me do this, i am fine with that. 
The importantly part is though, the initial charts for each of the machines manufactured by us have to be created by the freelancer (that is the work i am expecting to be done), so that i can take it further and start using the charts.

Given below is the expectation in the gantt charts.

1. I should be able to enter each sub-assembly (task) for the machine, in days or hours.

2. If anything gets delayed, the dependent tasks should automatically be pushed forward.

3. I should be able to track which sub-assembly has been delayed beyond its original timeline.

4. Each assembly's labour cost should be added. Material cost too can be added. This needs to be decided by us, provided we are able to clearly track offline (not in this program) how much worth of material has been issued

5. As far as the resource is concerned, basically one assembly can be done by one person or 2 persons or more.  In that case, lets assume we put names of each person, then either those 2 or 3 people will be taken as one team and a resource created. This could prove a bit wrong as one person could be moved around for some other work too. Therefore each person should be treated as a resource and we should show that 3 resources are working together to work on that assembly. 
That way, if one of the person is moved from one assembly to another, it should be doable. And then we can track if one of those persons is free when the other 2 are engaged.

6. I should be able to track % of each assembly done and % of total m/c work done.

7. If an assembly is delayed, i should be able to enter the reason for the delay. That will help me in tracking reasons for delays at various stages and will help us in ensuring the same thing is not repeated in the future machines.

Further, besides the above sub-assembly gantt chart, another chart would be the manufacturing of parts for each of the sub-assemblies (in effect the machine itself). The reason for making a separate chart for the parts is to avoid the chart becoming messy, as parts are in hundreds. So based on the sub-assembly work-breakdown-structure (the first chart), we decide that all parts of each of the sub-assemblies should be ready at least 2-3 days before the work on the respective sub-assembly begins. 

Now the production people need to manufacture the parts either from outside (outsourcing) or inside (which in our case is limited).  Each sub-contractor outside is treated as a resource and each part treated as an item (task), whose manufacturing timeline has to be entered.  Once the part is received, we have to show that task as done. 
Also, since the members who are in charge of producing the parts will be entering the status of parts in the chart on a regular basis, it will show us which parts are delayed and where we need to focus on, in respect of follow-up.  

What i want from the freelancer is to create these charts in ganttexcel (or any other economical gantt program, having these feature). Once I have received charts for each of the machines we manufacture, I will start using them straightaway and enter the actual work done and monitor the machine’s progress. Similarly the part-making chart also is needed.

We are looking for a data scientist to thoroughly inspect and analyze company data to help us make strategic decisions going forward. We are a wholesale distributor with around 25k skus and a customer base of about 10k.  Within the last three years we've acquired two other companies under the same name and brand. We hope to learn more about our entire customer base and identify demographics and buying behavior/drivers.  We want to analyze all sku's both current and discontinued to hone in on top producing products, allowing us to make calculated decisions for future buying.  Our most expensive cost, are the sample books allocated to buying customers (at no cost to them).  We need to identify those customers who are likely to bring highest ROI from the books and investigate all alternative solutions to cutting cost on these books. This could include using machine learning to test and predict the right level of frequency and quantity predicted to be most profitable, or determine alternative solutions to sample books altogether. We want to identify and fix what is and isn't working throughout the entire order process. The company as a whole will be analyzed for any and all areas in need for improvement, with the aim of increasing revenue. 

Data will be provided by NAV, PowerBI, online analytics, customer surveys

-Creative at solving complex problems
-Good at making statistically informed decisions 
-Confident and accurate at delivering predictions with proven track record of doing so
-A quantitative approach to analyzing data

I would appreciate your responding with the time you might assign for this stage of the project and the type of analysis you would recommend if you can think of alternative approaches, it would be a plus for you to suggest alternatives/additions to the suggested pipeline below

Essentially we are comparing an active disease state to common 4 rare diseases compared to the inactive state.. We've normalised the data using FRMA following by LIMMA so we have a gene list with relatively low expressions when one compares active disease state to non active disease state. We would like for you to suggest alternative methods for mining this dataset but here are the main requirements

We would like to perform the following in silico analysis
	1. Convert CEL files into gct files ( phenotype data will be provided) 
	2. Prepare an array expression file for each dataset
	3. Use cytoscape's gene mania to expand the very small list of genes which arise from the intersection between diseases 
	4. Use cytoscape to build network
	5. Report immune cell-type quantities ( using ImmQuant) as the dataset originates from whole blood.
	6. Perform transcription factor analysis of the results and validate the presence of the sequence of the predicted  transcription factors using ENCODE
	7. Apply WGCNA to find highly correlated gene clusters associated with the active state of disease by comparing between disesase states https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-559
	8. Identify co- expressed genes in specific pathways or mechanistic proceses or GO ontology 
	9. Provide methodology and results in clear easy to understand texts and data visualisations eg tables/ network diagrams 
10.Import and combine data from GEO dataset to combine the results ( a sort of metanalysis) . Not sure if this is appropriate as one study is of PBMCs and the other is whole blood.

We are looking to develop a long term relationship with someone who is willing to now and then travel to Stockholm so candidates located nearby are prefered.

----
When people in your office have a problem in Excel, are they asking you? Do you get a twitch in your eye when you see a risky and cumbersome process and you just wished that you had the time to fix that? When others are watching football, are your thoughts drifting on what makes a country good at football and start to think about how you can calculate that? Do you wish you had more time to learn VBA-programming properly or do you already speak VBA better than English?

Then this is the job for you.
We are the Exceldepartment, and we do not ask questions, we give answers. No one will call us when things are fine and dandy. People call us when there is a problem. 
When process that a summer-intern developed in 2002 has broken down, that is when we are needed. When a CEO start’s and he realize that there is no coherent pricing strategy, that is when he calls us. When a CFO has quit and slammed the door, but the reports still must be created, that is where we come into the picture.

We love Excel. We love to solve problems. We love to try new solutions.
We hate administration, that is why we are passionate about removing every last step of unnecessary step in a process. That is also why we often develop a solution first and then see if the client wants it. 

Because if you are as passionate about Excel as we are, the budget and other corporate-rituals will follow your passion and creativity. 

We created the Excel-Championship in cooperation with Microsoft. This year we will create an Excel-Art Exhibition where we will display Excel-reports as art.

Calculate the sample size required to give a p-value of less than 0.05 (α = 0.05). Provide calculations.

2)	Provide a couple paragraphs explaining your methodology and rationale. 

For example: 

Using a two-sided Z test of the difference between proportions with 80 % power and a 5 % significance level, a sample size of 1812 patients, 906 in each group, will be sufficient to detect a clinically important difference of 50 % between the groups in the rate of HAPUs. This assumes that a 50 % difference represents a change from a prevalence rate of 5 % for pressure ulcers in the control group, to a rate of 2.5 % for pressure ulcers in the treatment group. Conservatively, with an estimated enrollment of 200 subjects per month, study enrollment is expected to be between 7 and 10 months’ duration.

OR 

A target of 63 patients was selected based on achieving a 95% confidence interval, assuming a standard deviation of 0.5 and a margin of error of 12.3 percentage points. The following formula was used to calculate the estimated number of patients. (n = target sample size, sd = standard deviation, e = margin of error). Due to patient turnover on the unit, the baseline phase and postintervention phase patients were not the same patients.

- You will have strong problem solving, analytical and time management skills combined with exceptional communication skills.

About us
Look Who’s Charging is a multi-award winning, fast paced FinTech business. 

Often card holders don’t recognise transactions because the information provided to them on their credit or debit card statement is limited to a random string of characters. This confusion results in millions of wasted hours by card holders each year, millions of phone calls and bank branch visits and millions of unnecessary charge-backs.

Look Who's Charging has built a sophisticated search engine to align the transaction description per credit or debit card statements to rich details of the underlying merchant. This data is provided to banks via an API, and banks then pass the data to their customers via their mobile/desktop banking apps.  Less head scratching and time wasted for consumers, less charge-backs for merchants and less calls for banks! 

We currently power the data behind NAB’s banking applications.  By the end of the year our aim is for our data to be readily available to at least half the Australian population.

Look Who’s Charging recently won Money Magazine’s 2018 Most Innovative Banking Feature Award, FinTech Australia's 2018 Best Customer Experience Award as well as the prestigious CeBit Pitchfest in 2017."

Visual Identification & Segmentation of Scanned Documents in PDF,Less than 10 hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""Machine Learning""}]","I have a PDF file filled with scanned documents. These are standardized form documents that have IDs, standard formats, and distinguishable segments (although certain sections of a form may expand or contract in length in each instance). 

Also included in this PDF collection of scanned pages are identification documents (driver’s license, passport, etc). These are more sensitive documents and should be closely scrutinized from a privacy/security perspective. 

I am looking for someone to help design the appropriate image recognition capabilities to train a machine how to associate the many segments across the many documents in each PDF and then classify them as “evidence” of categorical questions (classifications with confidence). 

Additionally, as this “evidence” is classified for each PDF, I need the system to capture a “snapshot” of that particular segment for quick visual reference and confirmation by humans. Humans need the ability to adjust the segment “snapshots” identified by the system and the ability to adjust the classification of each segment. 

I would like to vegan with a proof-of-concept that will price the viability of the conceived AI system. Once proven, further investment will be made to scale and, eventually, automate recommendations/actions for humans using an RPA (Robitic Process Automation) system.

We cater to laboratories both in academia and industry, and we need someone who is a full-stack genius who can develop and debug our current platform. 

Somnivore is disrupting a 60-year-old industry by bringing machine learning and data mining to sleep science for the first time. We processed a month worth of data for a small team of scientists in a single day, with one user. Somnivore allows sleep scientists to bypass some of the oldest bottlenecks in the industry, freeing them to focus on more pressing and exciting explorations. Since the release of our working prototype in April 2017 Somnivore has raised over 100K USD through awards and sales. Moreover, Somnivore was the recipient of the prestigious Graham Clark Healthtech Innovation Challenge Prize in 2017. Somnivore is currently used by laboratories working on sleep science, drug discovery and psychedelic pharmacology. 

We have a bold vision to disrupt the research industry and progress into engineering solutions to harness the power of machine learning and neurofeedback technology toward maximizing human potential, in areas like meditation training, cognitive performance, flow and sleep quality. If chosen, you would play a major role in this transformation of this industry as well as the future expansion of the platform and the ripple effect it is having on both the lives of researchers and soon entrepreneurs and high performers around the world.

You must be a wizard with Matlab, and JAVA. You should be capable at developing GUIs, and be well versed in scientific data visualisation, machine learning, and be able to work on big data. Understanding of signal processing, spectral analysis, and EEG data is also a must.    

The position is challenging and requires a developer with experience, adaptability, and intuition. Our current solution and flagship product has been fully coded by our founder Dr. Giancarlo Allocca (aka Jack), during the course of his Ph.D. program. Coming from a background in Biology and Electrophysiology Jack is a self-made software engineer meaning the code quality is obscure and lacks a great deal of comments. This requires that you be capable of reverse engineering terrible code to replicate the intended features. Jack will provide full support in explaining the nature of the project and the coding style that was used to create it. 

We have a laid-back culture where you have a lot of responsibility but also a lot of freedom. You can work from anywhere where you have a reliable internet connection, and will not be micro-managed. 

We have two clients currently, and more undergoing trialing (some of the best universities in the world) who are waiting for a solid and scalable software before fully implementing it. 

Our team is primarily based in Australia, and embody a very bold vision for the future. Once we have consolidated our position in the research market we will branch to develop solutions for neurofeedback, cognitive training, and sleep health. This is a job full of excitement, freedom, and GROWTH. If you aren't looking to work hard, grow your skills, hone your craft and make new friends then DON'T apply.

We are looking for someone who is a real DRIVER and has a ""Get-Shit-Done"" attitude, meaning you complete tasks quickly and drive tasks to completion. You must be a quick learner and have the ability to remember technical details after only brief encounters.  You must have excellent spoken and written English, although an accent is ok. This is an optionally full-time position that will begin with 1-2 months of part-time hours as a trial phase before we hire full time. If you prefer to remain in a part-time position that’s OK too.

The job requires knowledge of Matlab and JAVA (and the willingness to learn or be already proficient at Python), as well as clean code work ethics. You must be able to prove your understanding of machine learning and signal processing. 

In your application please include your resume with 3 references, in the subject or body of your response please include the keywords at the top, ""Somnivore DOE Application"".

Please also rate yourself HONESTLY between 1-10 on the following skills:
> -Matlab
> -Matlab GUI dev
> -JAVA
> -Signal processing
> -Machine learning
> -Data visualisation
> -Python
> -Clean code
> -Linux system programming
> -MySQL
> -People Skills / personability
> -GSD (""Get-Shit-Done"")

If you are a good fit we will give you a simple but challenging paid test (as in we pay you for your time) to check your skills.

Pay is generous and is based on your skill set and experience. Excellent candidates may be offered equity in the company with time.

I work for myself and I am a small ppc ads one person business.  I  need to use Google data studio for adwords and Bing ads reports for a client.  I tested a few free templates and they work ok, but need more advanced features.  

1) Want the templates designed and linked as my client needs them.

2) Must be able to blend (combine) the data for some of the campaigns for both Bing ads and adwords.  Already know that Bing and Adwords can connect in separate tables, but need some campaigns to blend the data.  That is so that the data is displayed and calculated in one table for both Bing ads and Adwords. I tested with a connector from ""supermetrics"", but it is too buggy or I was not doing it correctly.

3) Client does not use Google analytics as I noticed there are some connectors for GA to gather the data, and then send it blended together to data studio, so that option is out.  I think they just started using Adobe analytics.  But the adwords and Bing tracking is my responsibility and I do not really want to work with their internal IT dept as they are new users and not sure how to do things.

Multidimensional Modelling and Dashboards with MODLR,10-30 hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""Cognos""}]","I run a Cognos and TM1 consulting business in Sydney. 

I am looking for someone who can learn a new toolset (MODLR) and then help my business in the long term to create a completely new and flexible model to help small to medium companies manage their business better. 

I need someone who has extensive experience with building financial management models with TM1, SAP BPC, Hyperion Planning or Anaplan who can learn quickly. MODLR is a highly flexible tool and competes with TM1, Anaplan etc.

Further, the final solution will involve the creation of a number of dashboards that integrate directly with the MODLR data.

When you apply for this project, please explain how your experience in multidimensional modelling and the use of that model in dashboards fits the project.

Spreadsheet logic programming,Less than 10 hrs/week,[],"1. This is a spreadsheet project which we need assistance since we do not have the Excel skills to finish our project.  

2. Specifically our project is to perform calculations in the lines Excel creates when subtotalling 
a) our spreadsheet contains multiple lines that make up one ""entry."" The subtotal function works well to break out entries. But we need the program to select only those entries where we have marked at least one of the lines ""y""
b) for those entries selected we need to perform basic functions (lookups, sums, if statements) on the line information within each entry, and present that data at the end of the subtotal line. 

3. We are able to tightly define how each cell is to function but we do not have the proficiency on staff to program the spreadsheet.

4. Since our spreadsheet is about 7 000 rows by 60 columns our preference is to have this functionality programmed.

5. We have different versions of Excel, from 2000 to 2016, and can accept output in any of these Excel formats.

6. Since the information is very confidential, we will not publicly post our spreadsheet.

7. Also we need maximum 48 hour turnaround - sorry but true.

A test group consists of a group of page URLS on a website. Let's say you have a blog with a category ""design"" with 10,000 posts. We might want to run a test that targets 1,000 of those posts, with 500 in control (unchanged) and 500 in the test (changed).

We are looking to determine if a test has successfully increased the CTR (click through rate, clicks and ranking) of a test group, factoring in seasonality, growth etc. 

The mathematics of this system should help account for other factors that may change. Things such as:

* Google Algorithm Updates
* Seasonality
* Competitor's changes
* Unrelated changes to the site

We want the result of a given test to not look at the trend of the traffic but rather look at the difference in performance between the control group and the variant.

I have other data sets, but let's start with this one for this job. Read the ""importing contacts"" instructions attached first. It will require reducing teh act database to 1000 contacts per file. IT would be best to set up a test import file first, then the first 1000 contacts. The ACT ID status field is most important for me to decide on inclusion or exclusion into the import. You will find a pivot table tab on the ACT export CRM file, showing the id status' on the raw tab. Use columns E and G to edit the subsequent CSV files you will need to set up. there are a little under 16000 records, but many are to be excluded (Do not import). Combine the edit files for me to review and possibly change id status (column G shows what ID status to change to for some files). I'll need to see  the rest in an edited file to make it easy to change, rather than through the database. You will not be importing all fields to lionedesk, only the required liondesk fields. You might make recommendatioins about custom fileds to bring across, like id status. So, I would recommend reviewing the liondesk sample, make sure it works, then with an act import sample, enduring the fields are populating correctly. Once you know the data  maps are good, you can break down the spreadhseets into the sets of less than 1000 or so (Does not have to be exact # due to combining id status' and their counts). So, 1) review instructions, 2) do a small test set to ensure fileds work properly. 3) determine if custom fields are required for our use. 4) break up master csv to files of less than 1000, sorted by id status. Send all files to me for final review prior to import. 5) Import. I think this is the plan. If you run into problems, let me know and we can clarify it. This is a one time job. I do have other data sets as a future job, but they are much smaller and easier than this one. At the end I should have a blank act template, the prepared files to import, and liondesk populated with the proper records, without errors. (You don't have control over bad entries, but no bad or duplicate records from this import). I will give liondesk access information upon awarding the job.

2018-08-15 I have updated the export file version 2.0, reducing the # of records to less than 3000. Maybe the job I gave is too wordy. I will be editing the job into smaller pieces until I can find a vendor who can complete the remainder."

Machine learning - Prediction - Regression,Less than 10 hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""Data Science""},{""skill"":""Machine Learning""}]","Who are we ?
An influencer marketing company launched in 2016.

What do we do?
We connect brands with Youtubers. Say you want to promote your product, we are going to find the right person to promote it (targeted audience, fame, actual influence...). 
Then, we are providing them with the brand guidelines and a tracking link to be able to measure their conversion. 
Finally we provide analytics to our clients (brands) on how much sales/installs they generated thanks to the number of clicks we measured. They can measure their ROI and we can measure how good an influencer was at selling a product. 

Example? 
Of course, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW8PF0hTWvA

What we want from you?
Since our first marketing campaigns, we learnt a lot on how selecting the influencers to get the best ROI. For example, it is better to select 10 influencers with 1M followers intead of 1 big influencer with 10M followers.
We want to automate the influencer selection process by analyzing past social media posts of an influencer and be able to measure his/her real influence.
The idea is to be able to predict the conversion rate, the ratio viewers to clickers. 

What we have done?
We had an intern who started a first draft but the results were not very accurate, probably because we did not gather enough data. 

We were thinking that a simple regression model based on many parameters will be the solution (linear or non linear regression)
We have a large set of data of click events associated with youtube videos. We also have a lot of data related to the videos and our goal is to predict the ratio of viewers who became clickers. 
In other words, we are trying to measure the influencer of a video on the viewers that make them click on a link below a video.

Example of data points: number of likes, number of comments, average length of the comments.
A repo is already set up with some Python code to gather these data points.

About the job?

You will talk directly to the CTO, he will reply to all the technical and business related questions. 
You are not required to deploy the project but a good documentation is essential. 
We will be able to deliver quickly any API endpoint to gather Youtube data if needed."

Visualizer Programming Using Processing,$180 ,"[{""skill"":""2D Animation""},{""skill"":""3D Animation""},{""skill"":""Animation""},{""skill"":""Processing""},{""skill"":""Visualization""}]","Hi there,

I am looking for some assistance in programming visuals for a sketch I am working on. The visuals will be controlled using variables that fluctuate according to incoming OSC messages. I already have this basic structure setup and just need help creating interesting visuals utilizing movement, shapes, colour and textures etc. I would be interesting in paying for a few additions and revisions and perhaps if this goes well, additional projects in the future. All of the ‘variables’ specified within the objects can be set up as whatever you like and I can modify the incoming OSC message address to suit. Feel free to name the inputs and variables however you see fit and I will make sure the OSC address reflect this.

Here are some layer objects I would like created (on separate tabs);

Base ‘Canvas’ layer – an array of images that I can add to over time that slowly transform into each image
Texture Layer – A transparent layer on top of the canvas layer that ripples from the center when a variable reaches a certain limit (I have a reference for this - https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/81825#)
-	An additional variable that makes small rain droplets when a second variable reaches a certain limit
Shape 1 Layer – A simple parametric shape (lots of examples on YouTube – I can gather some if you want the job) that scales as a variable fluctuates
Particle layer – when a variable reaches a certain limit particles explode from the center, and then gravitate back to the center as the variable returns back below threshold (see references)
https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/562226
https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/530227 
Line/Curve layer – 1 variable to control the amount of bend/curvature of a horizontal beam. Variable also controls the height of the beam.

I am not at home right now, so I will be able to send you the basic sketch I have so far when I get back to my computer. I firstly just wanted to see who might be available and if you have any reference material of your own that I can see?

In summary, I am wanting to create many different visual layers controlled by variables that fluctuate according to fluctuating incoming OSC messages. I am happy for you to get creative and explore what is possible here. Please, if you have any suggestions on how this idea might become more interesting, I would be open to your input and can discuss different option with you.

I look forward to working with you.

MatLab Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis,10-30 hrs/week,"[{""skill"":""MATLAB""},{""skill"":""MATLAB Script""},{""skill"":""Statistics""}]","Company Background
Alligant Scientific was founded in 2013 based on a method for touchless, heatless, pressure-free materials manipulation. Since mid-2017 the company has been developing solutions focused on battery electrode healing using pure zinc and lithium battery chemistries. Target applications include solutions applicable for grid storage, UPS backup, electric vehicle and consumer electronics.
 
Project Overview
Alligant Scientific is developing a feedback-based control system utilizing machine learning.  In this project machine learning will be utilized to process data and evolve an accurate predictive model which can receive data from our ongoing experimentation and predict and provide the best variable values to optimally improve outputs from our experiments.  This model will be exportable for use in a separate, standalone program.  Both existing and continuously updating data sets will be used.
 
Matlab is currently planned for model development given its relatively accessible GUI compared to other frameworks.  However, environments such as Tensorflow may be considered if there is compelling motivation and all project needs can still be met.
 
You will assist Alligant’s team in the planning and execution of this project.
1.	Advise on experiment testing approach including number of dependent and independent variables to test concurrently, number of tests per design of experiment, determination of most important variables tested, etc.
2.	Examine historical and ongoing new data sets, including experimental input parameters as well as numerical, categorical and graphical results, and advise on the best approaches to machine learning and predictive modeling.
a.	Matlab vs other frameworks for machine learning
b.	Formatting of data for efficient processing
c.	Processing hardware recommendations
d.	Advise on number of samples needed and modeling approach
e.	Additional topics as needed
3.	Remotely access a terminal at Alligant to utilize Matlab or other framework 
4.	Execute machine learning analysis using data and periodically advise on outcomes, progress, and potential for improvement.
5.	Assist team in performing separate model studies
6.	Renew models as data sets are periodically updated (additional data points) on a weekly basis
7.	Goal is the production of a predictive model which can be exported as code for later implementation in a process control system.
Each data point in a set has available the following parameter formats:
•	Multiple discrete single values
•	Classifiers (ex: Pass, Fail)
•	2D arrays
•	2D images
•	3D images/CAD/point cloud files
Some or all of this data may be used in the machine learning process depending upon utility, ease of importability and analysis, and available processing power.

It is envisioned that the project will progress through the following phases:
1.	Classification modeling
a.	Productive modeling with relatively small number of data points (~1500, each with many parameters)
b.	Binary classification output of Pass/Fail
2.	Regression-based modeling
a.	More advanced modeling that accepts additional, and more complex, input parameters
b.	Input will include the same data set used for classification modeling, now with additional parameters
c.	Take advantage of transfer learning using initial classification models
d.	Output/Response data will be discrete values
e.	Result:  Model can read input data and estimate the appropriate output values.  The model can be exported for integration into standalone software.
 
Requirements:
•	Competency with all aspects of machine learning with Matlab
•	Experience in other machine learning frameworks is welcomed
•	Proven background in statistical methods and regression analysis
•	Sign non-disclosure agreement (NDA) affirming confidentiality of all data and communication during this project
•	Be available for weekly or bi-weekly meetings via video conference (Skype or other)
•	Ability to remotely access Alligant computer systems to using TeamViewer or Chrome Remote Desktop"

Statistical analysis of garment measurements,$200 ,"[{""skill"":""Statistics""}]","Hi there,

We are a tailoring company, whereby we take body measurements and then predict the garment measurements for the customer. 

I am looking for some help with statistical analysis / data analysis using thousands of existing (anonymous) customer and garment measures in order to help predict the size for new customers and suggest MIN and MAX values for specific garment measures.

For new customers, for specific body height (rounded to full cm taking into account) I'd like to get predicted MIN and MAX values based on existing data set using [90 or 95]% confidence interval. The comparison should include the body height +/- [5cm]. For example, for a body height of 180cm if should compare existing measures of 175 - 185cm and compare e.g. sleeve length and derive a suggested MIN and MAX using 90 or 95% confidence intervals. 

This is an iterative process as we'd like to learn from our data, so the method / intervals can change. For example, besides the body height, the independent variables may also include chest circumference and/or shoulder width as that could lead to better prediction - some playing around with data will be required.

Our system uses Java, and the data can be exported in csv format. You should be able to build functions in Excel that allow us to update the data going forward. At a later stage the above MIN and MAX calculations should be automated and integrated in Ruby so if you have background in that this is an asset (this will be a separate project).

Predicted measures (MIN / MAX) for:
Neck
Chest (could be used as independent variable?)
Waist high
Waist belly-button
Hip
Shoulder (could be used as independent variable?)
Sleeve length
Biceps
Cuff (arm)
Waist (trouser)

The labeling process has been performed in two steps: First we hired a set of annotators, to label 3D bounding boxes as tracklets in point clouds. Since for a pedestrian tracklet, a single 3D bounding box tracklet (dimensions have been fixed) often fits badly, we additionally labeled the left/right boundaries of each object by making use of Mechanical Turk. We also collected labels of the object's occlusion state, and computed the object's truncation via backprojecting a car/pedestrian model into the image plan.

We cater to laboratories both in academia and industry, and we need someone who is a full-stack genius who can develop and debug our current platform. 

Somnivore is disrupting a 60-year-old industry by bringing machine learning and data mining to sleep science for the first time. We processed a month worth of data for a small team of scientists in a single day, with one user. Somnivore allows sleep scientists to bypass some of the oldest bottlenecks in the industry, freeing them to focus on more pressing and exciting explorations. Since the release of our working prototype in April 2017 Somnivore has raised over 100K USD through awards and sales. Moreover, Somnivore was the recipient of the prestigious Graham Clark Healthtech Innovation Challenge Prize in 2017. Somnivore is currently used by laboratories working on sleep science, drug discovery and psychedelic pharmacology. 

We have a bold vision to disrupt the research industry and progress into engineering solutions to harness the power of machine learning and neurofeedback technology toward maximizing human potential, in areas like meditation training, cognitive performance, flow and sleep quality. If chosen, you would play a major role in this transformation of this industry as well as the future expansion of the platform and the ripple effect it is having on both the lives of researchers and soon entrepreneurs and high performers around the world.

You must be a wizard with Matlab and JAVA. You should be capable at developing GUIs, and be well versed in scientific data visualisation, machine learning, and be able to work on big data. Understanding of signal processing, spectral analysis, and EEG data is also a must.    

The position is challenging and requires a developer with experience, adaptability, and intuition. Our current solution and flagship product has been fully coded by our founder Dr. Giancarlo Allocca (aka Jack), during the course of his Ph.D. program. Coming from a background in Biology and Electrophysiology Jack is a self-made software engineer meaning the code quality is obscure and lacks a great deal of comments. This requires that you be capable of reverse engineering terrible code to replicate the intended features. Jack will provide full support in explaining the nature of the project and the coding style that was used to create it. 

We have a laid-back culture where you have a lot of responsibility but also a lot of freedom. You can work from anywhere where you have a reliable internet connection, and will not be micro-managed. 

We have two clients currently, and more undergoing trialing (some of the best universities in the world) who are waiting for a solid and scalable software before fully implementing it. 

Our team is primarily based in Australia, and embody a very bold vision for the future. Once we have consolidated our position in the research market we will branch to develop solutions for neurofeedback, cognitive training, and sleep health. This is a job full of excitement, freedom, and GROWTH. If you aren't looking to work hard, grow your skills, hone your craft and make new friends then DON'T apply.

We are looking for someone who is a real DRIVER and has a ""Get-Shit-Done"" attitude, meaning you complete tasks quickly and drive tasks to completion. You must be a quick learner and have the ability to remember technical details after only brief encounters.  You must have excellent spoken and written English, although an accent is ok. This is an optionally full-time position that will begin with 1-2 months of part-time hours as a trial phase before we hire full time. If you prefer to remain in a part-time position that’s OK too.

The job requires knowledge of Matlab and JAVA (and the willingness to learn or be already proficient at Python), as well as clean code work ethics. You must be able to prove your understanding of machine learning and signal processing. 

In your application please include your resume with 3 references, in the subject or body of your response please include the keywords at the top, ""Somnivore DOE Application"".

Please also rate yourself HONESTLY between 1-10 on the following skills:
> -Matlab
> -Matlab GUI dev

They capture all of the data we need but they don't have a simple report we need built into the system.

We need someone to create the SQL call, implement it into our system and supply instructions and workflow to print the report.  

Attached is an example of the report we would like created from the database.

A description of the attached is below:

Attached is a report that would give us a snapshot overview of our employees output through the day. Most of these metrics are already existing in the system, the new one is “Efficient Minutes”. This metric can be calculated by:

If Guardian stores Labor Efficiency as a percentage (i.e. 60% = .600):
(Efficient Minutes) = (Direct Run Hours)*(Labor Efficiency)*60

If Guardian stores Labor Efficiency as a number (i.e. 60% = 60.0):
(Efficient Minutes) = (Direct Run Hours)*(Labor Efficiency)*60/100

A few additional items:

1)	I would like to see this report segregated by department, but I do not want to see it segregated by individual employee. Regardless of how many days the report covers, I would like to see each employee listed multiple times in the same report, one listing for each day. So the report would be segregated by department, then sorted by employee first, labor date second. If we had a report printed for 5 employees for the week, there would be 25 lines of data, each employee listed 5 times.
2)	I do not want to see totals at the bottom, I want to see averages for the department.
3)	I want the spacing between rows to be larger than it is on the current reports. The spacing on the sample is far easier to read than the reports we are printing off of Guardian right now."

Data Cleaning,$70 ,[],"I have a very large dataset (hundreds of millions of observations) of items' and services' prices over time. Though I have the data at the item level, sometimes slightly different versions of the same item are coded as the same one (for instance iphone 7 and iphone 8). Additionally, prices are sometimes coded with error. 
I am looking to identify price changes for each item. This should be easy to do manually, but the data is way to large to do so. Instead I am looking for a script to find these price changes. I am willing to provide a subset of the data to train  and  develop the algorithm. 
I cannot however provide you with the full data, so there are 2 options:
1. you will write a script that I can run on my machine.
2. you can explain the algorithm to me and I will code it in my program (stata)

To be super explicit, this might prove to be more complicated than it sounds. I attached below a few items to show what data look like for various items. It describes items for which you just have to find the date, items that should be dropped from the analysis completely, and item that have price changes, but need significant cleaning.  It is extremely important to identify the price cutoff precisely, since this is the focus of the analysis. Also, it is very important to include as many items as possible. 
I will not accept poorly done or inaccurate work- I can do a decent job myself, but I need great job!"

If you have a tool, we can use, or if you can manually find the leads more efficiently than our existing methods, I would like to hire you. 

I want to be able to provide you with various product categories, and you can build lists of sellers who are selling in this category. I am happy to pay on a per-lead basis, or if you have a tool that can accomplish this, I would be happy to license the tool.

If this is something you can do, please apply for this gig and let me know what you need from me, and what you will be able to deliver."
